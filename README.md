# Language Model Prompt Tool (LMPT)

LMPT is a library with functions to construct powerful, multi-step language model prompts. For example, using the write_book() function, you can ask in a single function call ask an arbitrary language model to write an entire book for you. This, under the hood, uses a structured series of prompts designed for this purpose that you can find in the write_book.py file.
