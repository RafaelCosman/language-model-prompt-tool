## A. Definition of Hidradenitis Suppurativa

### Definition
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory skin disease characterized by painful, deep-seated abscesses and tunneling sinus tracts in the axillae, groin, and perineum. It is also known as acne inversa.

### Symptoms
The main symptoms of HS are recurrent abscesses and painful nodules, as well as scarring and tunneling sinus tracts in the affected areas. The affected areas can include the axillae, groin, perineum, and buttocks. Other associated symptoms can include fever, chills, malaise, and fatigue.

### Diagnosis
HS is typically diagnosed based on the patient's medical history and a physical exam. Diagnostic tests may include blood tests, imaging studies, and biopsies.

### Prognosis
The prognosis for HS is variable, and depends on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to treatment. In some cases, HS can be managed with lifestyle modifications and medications, while in more severe cases, surgery may be required.

### Prevention
There is no known way to prevent HS, but there are some lifestyle modifications that can help reduce the risk of flare-ups. These include avoiding tight-fitting clothing, avoiding shaving or waxing the affected areas, and avoiding hot, humid environments. Additionally, it is important to practice good hygiene and to keep the affected areas clean and dry.

## B. Prevalence of Hidradenitis Suppurativa


### Prevalence
Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent skin disorder that affects approximately 1-4% of the population. It is more common in women than men, with a female to male ratio of 3:1. It is most commonly seen in people between the ages of 18 and 40, with the highest prevalence in individuals between the ages of 20 and 29. HS is also more common in smokers, people with obesity, and those with a family history of the condition.

## C. Signs and Symptoms of Hidradenitis Suppurativa


Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects the apocrine sweat glands. Commonly referred to as “acne inversa”, HS is characterized by recurrent boils or abscesses in the armpits, groin, and other areas of the body where apocrine sweat glands are present.

The signs and symptoms of HS vary from person to person, but can include:

- Boils or abscesses: These are red, swollen bumps that can be painful and filled with pus. They can appear in areas of the body where apocrine sweat glands are present, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks, and breasts.
- Fistulas: These are tunnels that form under the skin and can connect two or more abscesses. They can be painful and may ooze pus.
- Scarring: The boils and abscesses of HS can cause scarring of the skin.
- Pain: Pain and tenderness in the affected area can be a symptom of HS.
- Itching: Itching is a common symptom of HS.
- Odor: The boils and abscesses of HS can produce a foul odor.

The severity of HS can vary from person to person. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and can come and go in cycles. In some cases, HS can lead to significant physical and emotional distress.

## D. Types of Hidradenitis Suppurativa

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent boils, cysts, and abscesses in the armpits, groin, and other areas of the body covered by skin folds. It is classified into three different types, depending on the severity and duration of the condition.

##### Type 1

Type 1, also known as localized HS, is the mildest form of the condition. It is characterized by recurrent boils or abscesses in one or two areas of the body. The boils usually heal without scarring, but may recur in the same area.

##### Type 2

Type 2, also known as moderate HS, is characterized by recurrent boils or abscesses in three or more areas of the body. The boils may leave scars, and the condition may last for years.

##### Type 3

Type 3, also known as severe HS, is the most severe form of the condition. It is characterized by recurrent boils or abscesses in multiple areas of the body, as well as deep abscesses and extensive scarring. The condition may last for years and can be disabling.

Practice Problem:

What type of Hidradenitis Suppurativa is characterized by recurrent boils or abscesses in multiple areas of the body, as well as deep abscesses and extensive scarring?

Answer: Type 3, also known as severe HS, is the most severe form of the condition. It is characterized by recurrent boils or abscesses in multiple areas of the body, as well as deep abscesses and extensive scarring.

## E. Diagnosis of Hidradenitis Suppurativa

### Diagnostic Criteria

The diagnosis of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is based on physical examination and a patient’s history. The diagnostic criteria for HS include:

- Recurrent, painful, deep-seated nodules
- Clusters of nodules in areas where skin rubs together (e.g. armpits, groin, under the breasts)
- Nodules that may open, ooze pus, and form tunnels under the skin
- Scarring of the affected area
- Presence of sinus tracts

### Diagnostic Tests

In addition to physical examination, the doctor may order a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis of HS. These tests may include:

- Blood tests to check for inflammation and infection
- Skin biopsy to rule out other skin conditions
- Imaging tests such as X-rays or CT scans to look for sinus tracts
- Skin cultures to check for infection

### Differential Diagnosis

The doctor may also consider other skin conditions that have similar symptoms to HS before making a diagnosis. These conditions include:

- Acne
- Sebaceous cysts
- Folliculitis
- Boils
- Abscesses
- Cellulitis
- Erythema nodosum
- Crohn’s disease
- Lupus
- Psoriasis

## F. Complications of Hidradenitis Suppurativa

Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) can cause a number of complications that can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life. The most common complications of HS include:

#### Skin Infections

HS lesions are prone to infection due to their open nature. Bacterial infections are the most common, and can cause the area to become red, swollen, and painful. In some cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, causing more severe symptoms.

#### Scarring

The lesions caused by HS can lead to scarring, which can be permanent. The scarring can be disfiguring, and can cause emotional distress. In some cases, the scarring can also lead to a decrease in mobility, as the tissue becomes less flexible.

#### Abscesses

Abscesses are collections of pus that can form in the lesions caused by HS. They can be painful and can cause the area to become swollen and red. If the abscess is not treated, it can lead to further infection and scarring.

#### Emotional Distress

The physical effects of HS can lead to emotional distress. The lesions can be disfiguring, and can cause a person to feel embarrassed or ashamed. In addition, the pain and discomfort caused by HS can lead to depression and anxiety.

#### Social Isolation

The physical and emotional effects of HS can lead to social isolation. The lesions can be embarrassing and can make it difficult for a person to interact with others. In addition, the emotional distress caused by HS can lead to a decrease in social activity.

## G. Treatment for Hidradenitis Suppurativa

# 2. Causes and Risk Factors


## A. Genetic Factors


### Overview

Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin condition that is believed to have a genetic component. It is estimated that 30-50% of individuals with HS have a family history of the condition. While the exact gene(s) that cause HS are not yet known, researchers have identified several gene mutations that are associated with an increased risk of developing the condition.

### Genes Associated with HS

The following genes have been identified as being associated with an increased risk of developing HS:

- **MC1R**: The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Mutations in this gene have been linked to an increased risk of HS, as well as other skin conditions such as psoriasis and vitiligo.

- **IL-1**: The interleukin-1 (IL-1) gene is involved in inflammation and immune system responses. Mutations in this gene have been linked to an increased risk of HS.

- **TNF-alpha**: The tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene is involved in inflammation and immune system responses. Mutations in this gene have been linked to an increased risk of HS.

- **IL-23**: The interleukin-23 (IL-23) gene is involved in inflammation and immune system responses. Mutations in this gene have been linked to an increased risk of HS.

- **IL-17**: The interleukin-17 (IL-17) gene is involved in inflammation and immune system responses. Mutations in this gene have been linked to an increased risk of HS.

- **IL-10**: The interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene is involved in inflammation and immune system responses. Mutations in this gene have been linked to an increased risk of HS.

### Genetic Testing

Genetic testing is available to help identify which gene mutations may be associated with an increased risk of developing HS in an individual. However, it is important to note that genetic testing is not a diagnostic tool and should not be used to make a diagnosis of HS. Instead, it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools to help identify individuals who may be at an increased risk of developing HS.

### Summary

In summary, mutations in several genes have been linked to an increased risk of developing Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). These genes are involved in inflammation, immune system responses, and melanin production. While genetic testing is available to help identify which gene mutations may be associated with an increased risk of developing HS in an individual, it should not be used to make a diagnosis of HS.

## B. Hormonal Factors


### Overview

Hormones play an important role in the development of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). Androgens, or male hormones, are the primary hormones associated with HS. High levels of androgens can cause an increase in sebum, or oil, production. This can lead to the inflammation and blockage of the hair follicles that is characteristic of HS.

### Androgens

Androgens are hormones that are present in both men and women. The primary androgen associated with HS is testosterone, but other androgens, such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenedione, may also be involved.

Androgens are produced primarily in the testes in men and the ovaries in women. They are also produced in smaller amounts in the adrenal glands.

### Hyperandrogenism

Hyperandrogenism is a condition in which there are abnormally high levels of androgens in the body. This can occur due to a number of factors, including genetic or hormonal imbalances, certain medications, or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Hyperandrogenism is associated with an increased risk of developing HS. Women with PCOS are more likely to develop HS than women without the condition.

### Treatment

Treatment for hyperandrogenism usually involves medications that reduce the production of androgens or block their effects. These medications can include oral contraceptives, anti-androgens, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.

In some cases, lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss, exercise, and stress reduction, can help reduce androgen levels.

### Practice Problem

1. What is hyperandrogenism?
2. What are the primary hormones associated with HS?
3. What medications can be used to treat hyperandrogenism?

Answers:
1. Hyperandrogenism is a condition in which there are abnormally high levels of androgens in the body.
2. The primary hormones associated with HS are testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and androstenedione.
3. Medications that can be used to treat hyperandrogenism include oral contraceptives, anti-androgens, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.

## C. Environmental Factors

### Air Pollution
Air pollution is an environmental factor that has been linked to an increased risk of developing Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). Studies have found that people living in areas with higher levels of air pollution are more likely to develop the condition. It is thought that air pollutants may trigger inflammation in the skin, leading to the development of HS.

### Water Pollution
Water pollution is another environmental factor that may contribute to the development of HS. A study published in 2017 found that exposure to polluted water was associated with an increased risk of HS. The study also found that exposure to certain types of pollutants, such as heavy metals, was associated with a higher risk of HS.

### Sun Exposure
Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is another environmental factor that may contribute to the development of HS. UV radiation is known to cause inflammation in the skin, which can trigger the development of HS. Therefore, it is important to protect your skin from the sun by wearing sunscreen and protective clothing when going outside.

### Chemical Exposure
Exposure to certain chemicals, such as pesticides and solvents, may also increase the risk of developing HS. These chemicals can cause inflammation in the skin, which can trigger the development of HS. Therefore, it is important to avoid contact with these chemicals whenever possible.

### Practice Problem

1. What environmental factors are associated with an increased risk of developing Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)?
2. How can you protect your skin from the sun to reduce the risk of developing HS?

Answers:
1. Air pollution, water pollution, sun exposure, and chemical exposure are all associated with an increased risk of developing HS.
2. To protect your skin from the sun and reduce the risk of developing HS, you should wear sunscreen and protective clothing when going outside.

## D. Smoking

### Impact of Smoking

Smoking is a major risk factor for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Studies have shown that smokers are more likely to develop HS than non-smokers, and that smoking can make HS symptoms more severe. In a study of over 400 patients with HS, it was found that the majority of participants were smokers, and that smoking was associated with a higher risk of developing HS.

### Effects of Quitting

When patients with HS quit smoking, their symptoms tend to improve. In a study of over 400 patients with HS, it was found that those who quit smoking had a decrease in the severity of their symptoms. This suggests that quitting smoking can help improve HS symptoms and reduce the risk of developing HS.

### Practice Problems

1. What is the impact of smoking on HS?
2. What are the effects of quitting smoking for HS patients?

## E. Obesity


### Definition

Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by their height (in meters) squared. A person is considered to be overweight if their BMI is between 25 and 29.9.

### Risk Factors

Obesity is a risk factor for Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). People who are overweight or obese are more likely to develop HS than those who are not. This is because obesity can lead to changes in hormone levels, inflammation, and other factors that can increase the risk of HS.

### Treatment

Weight loss is an important part of HS treatment. Losing weight can help reduce inflammation, improve hormone levels, and reduce the risk of HS flare-ups. It is important to note that weight loss can be difficult and should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

Weight loss can be achieved through dietary changes, such as reducing calorie intake, eating more fruits and vegetables, and avoiding processed foods. Exercise can also help with weight loss, as well as improve overall health.

### Practice Problems

1. Calculate the BMI of a person who weighs 140 pounds and is 5 feet 8 inches tall.

Answer: BMI = (140 lbs / 2.2 kg/lb) / (5 ft 8 in x 0.3048 m/ft)^2 = 29.5 kg/m^2

2. Name three dietary changes that can help with weight loss.

Answer:
- Reduce calorie intake
- Eat more fruits and vegetables
- Avoid processed foods

## F. Hygiene


### What is Hygiene?
Hygiene is the practice of keeping oneself clean and free from disease-causing germs. It is an important factor in maintaining good health and reducing the risk of developing Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). Proper hygiene can help reduce inflammation, irritation, and infection of the affected areas.

### What are the Hygiene Practices for HS?
- **Bathing:** It is important to keep the affected area clean and dry. It is recommended to use a mild, non-scented, soap-free cleanser and lukewarm water when bathing. Avoid scrubbing the area and pat the skin dry after bathing.

- **Clothing:** Wear loose-fitting clothing to reduce friction and irritation. It is best to avoid tight-fitting clothing and synthetic fabrics. Cotton and other natural fabrics are preferred.

- **Shaving:** Shaving should be avoided in areas affected by HS. If shaving is necessary, use an electric razor and avoid using a blade.

- **Washing:** Wash hands regularly with soap and water, especially after touching the affected area.

## G. Bacterial Infections


### Overview

Bacterial infections can play a role in the development of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). This is because the infection can cause inflammation in the affected areas of the skin, leading to the development of lesions. Bacterial infections can also trigger the body’s immune system to respond, which can also lead to HS.

### Types of Bacterial Infections

There are several types of bacteria that can lead to HS. These include:

- Staphylococcus aureus: This is a type of bacteria that is commonly found on the skin and can cause infection. It is a common cause of HS.

- Streptococcus pyogenes: This is a type of bacteria that is commonly found in the throat and can cause infection. It can also cause HS.

- Propionibacterium acnes: This is a type of bacteria that is commonly found on the skin and can cause infection. It can also cause HS.

### Symptoms

The symptoms of a bacterial infection can vary depending on the type of bacteria involved. Generally, however, the symptoms of a bacterial infection may include:

- Redness
- Swelling
- Pain
- Itching
- Pus
- Fever
- Fatigue

In order to diagnose a bacterial infection, your doctor may perform a physical examination, as well as order tests such as blood tests, urine tests, and skin cultures.

### Treatment

The treatment for a bacterial infection will depend on the type of bacteria involved. Generally, however, the treatment may include antibiotics, either topically or orally. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the infected area.

### Prevention

The best way to prevent a bacterial infection is to practice good hygiene. This includes washing your hands regularly and avoiding contact with people who are known to have a bacterial infection. Additionally, if you have an open wound, it is important to keep it clean and covered.

## H. Immune System Dysfunction


### Overview

The immune system is responsible for protecting the body against foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. When functioning properly, the immune system can recognize and respond to these invaders, eliminating them before they cause harm. However, when the immune system is weakened or dysregulated, it can fail to respond appropriately, leading to an increased risk of infection, as well as other health problems. Immune system dysfunction has been linked to the development of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).

### Causes

The exact cause of HS is unknown, but it is believed to be related to an immune system dysfunction. Abnormalities in the immune system can lead to an overactive response, which can cause inflammation and damage to the skin. This type of immune system dysfunction is believed to contribute to the development of HS.

### Risk Factors

Certain conditions can increase the risk of developing HS due to an impaired immune system. These include autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Other conditions, such as diabetes and HIV, can also weaken the immune system and increase the risk of HS.

### Symptoms

The primary symptom of HS is recurrent, painful, and inflamed lumps or nodules on the skin. These lumps can be red, swollen, and filled with pus. They may be tender to the touch and may cause discomfort or pain. The lumps may also become infected, leading to further inflammation and pain.

### Diagnosis

Immune system dysfunction can be difficult to diagnose, as the symptoms can be similar to other conditions. To diagnose HS, your doctor may perform a physical exam and review your medical history. Your doctor may also order blood tests to check for signs of inflammation or infection. In some cases, a skin biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

### Treatment

Treatment for HS often involves medications to reduce inflammation and pain. These medications may include antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and immune-modulating drugs. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected areas.

### Prevention

The best way to prevent HS is to maintain a healthy immune system. This can be done by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and avoiding stress. It is also important to avoid smoking, as smoking can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of HS.

## I. Stress


### Stress as a Risk Factor

Stress can play a role in the development, progression, and severity of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Stress can be both physical and psychological, and both can have a negative effect on the body. Stress can lead to a weakened immune system, which can make it more difficult for the body to fight off infection and inflammation. Additionally, stress can lead to changes in the body’s hormone levels, which can also contribute to the development of HS.

### Signs of Stress

It is important to be aware of the signs of stress and to take steps to reduce stress levels when possible. Common signs of stress include:

- Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or irritable
- Difficulty concentrating
- Difficulty sleeping
- Low energy
- Headaches
- Muscle tension
- Upset stomach

### Managing Stress

Managing stress is an important part of managing HS. Here are some tips for managing stress:

- Identify the sources of stress in your life and take steps to reduce or eliminate them.
- Establish regular routines and stick to them.
- Make sure you get enough sleep.
- Exercise regularly.
- Take time for yourself to relax and do activities that you enjoy.
- Practice mindfulness and meditation.
- Talk to a therapist or counselor if needed.
- Reach out to family and friends for support.
- Practice positive self-talk.
- Keep a journal to document your thoughts and feelings.

## J. Diet

# 3. Symptoms and Diagnosis


## A. Overview of Symptoms


### Overview

Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by recurrent, painful, and inflamed lesions. It is a long-term condition that can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life.

The most common symptom of HS is the presence of painful, inflamed lesions. These lesions can vary in size and shape and can occur in various locations on the body. They are usually found in areas where there is friction, such as the armpits, groin, and buttocks. The lesions can be filled with pus and can cause discomfort, itching, and burning.

### Types of Lesions

The lesions associated with HS can be divided into three types:

- **Abscesses**: These are large, pus-filled lesions that are often tender and painful. They can be accompanied by a fever and may require medical intervention to drain the pus.

- **Nodules**: These are smaller, hard lumps that can be painful and tender. They may be red or purple in color.

- **Fistulas**: These are tunnels that form between two or more lesions, allowing pus and other fluids to drain from one area to another.

### Locations of Lesions

The lesions associated with HS can occur anywhere on the body, but are most commonly found in areas where there is friction, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks, and inner thighs. They can also occur on the breasts, back, and scalp.

### Complications

In some cases, HS can lead to complications such as:

- Infections: HS can cause bacterial infections, which can lead to fever, chills, and other symptoms.

- Scarring: HS can cause scarring of the skin, which can lead to permanent disfigurement.

- Pain: The lesions associated with HS can be painful and can cause significant discomfort.

- Emotional distress: Living with HS can be emotionally difficult, and can lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, and frustration.

## B. Different Types of Lesions


Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin condition that causes painful lumps and abscesses in areas of the body where there are sweat glands, such as the armpits and groin. These lumps and abscesses are known as lesions. Lesions can vary in size, shape, and appearance.

### Types of Lesions

HS lesions can be divided into three types:

- **Primary lesions** are the earliest and most common type of lesion. These are small, red bumps or nodules that may be painful. They can develop into abscesses, or boil-like lumps, which can burst and ooze pus.

- **Secondary lesions** are the result of primary lesions that have ruptured and become infected. These lesions are larger and more painful than primary lesions, and they may be filled with pus.

- **Tertiary lesions** are the result of recurrent infections. These lesions are larger and more painful than primary and secondary lesions, and they may have scarring or thickening of the skin.

### Examples of Lesions

Primary lesions can appear as small, red bumps or nodules that may be painful. They can range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. They may also be filled with pus.

Secondary lesions can appear as larger, more painful, pus-filled lumps. They may be red and inflamed, and they may be tender to the touch.

Tertiary lesions can appear as large, painful, pus-filled lumps. They may also have scarring or thickening of the skin.

You can also connect with online support communities through social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Many organizations and advocacy groups have their own social media accounts and they often post updates and information about Hidradenitis Suppurativa.

Finally, you can also connect with online support communities through dedicated websites and apps. These are usually designed specifically for people living with Hidradenitis Suppurativa and can provide a great way to find information, support and resources.

No matter which method you choose, it is important to remember to practice online safety. Always be sure to use a secure connection and only share personal information with people you trust.
