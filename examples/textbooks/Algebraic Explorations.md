# 1. Introduction to Algebra


## A. Definition of Algebra


### What is Algebra?
Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. In algebra, we use symbols to represent numbers and unknowns, and use those symbols to form equations, inequalities, and other mathematical statements. Algebra is used to solve problems by finding unknown values, or to determine whether a statement is true or false.

### Symbols
Algebra uses symbols to represent numbers and unknowns. The most common symbols are:
- **Variables**: Variables are symbols that represent unknown values. Common variables are x, y, z, a, b, and c.
- **Constants**: Constants are symbols that represent known values. Common constants are numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
- **Operators**: Operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and constants. Common operators are + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division).

### Equations
An equation is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal. An equation will have an equal sign (=) and two expressions on either side of the equal sign. For example:

```
2x + 4 = 10
```

In this equation, the left side (2x + 4) is equal to the right side (10). We can solve this equation by finding the value of x.

### Inequalities
An inequality is a mathematical statement that two expressions are not equal. An inequality will have an inequality sign (<, >, ≤, ≥) and two expressions on either side of the sign. For example:

```
2x + 4 > 10
```

In this inequality, the left side (2x + 4) is greater than the right side (10). We can solve this inequality by finding all values of x that make the inequality true.

### Examples
Let's look at a few examples of algebraic equations and inequalities:

1. **Equation**: 3x + 2 = 10
   - Solution: x = 4

2. **Inequality**: 2x + 4 < 10
   - Solution: x < 3

3. **Equation**: 2x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 3 = 0
   - Solution: x = 1 or x = 3

4. **Inequality**: x<sup>2</sup> + 4x - 5 > 0
   - Solution: x > -1 and x < 5

### Practice Problems
Try solving the following algebraic equations and inequalities:

1. **Equation**: 5x - 4 = 16

2. **Inequality**: 3x - 7 < 11

3. **Equation**: x<sup>2</sup> + 5x - 6 = 0

4. **Inequality**: 2x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 11 ≤ 0

### Summary
Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. Algebra uses variables, constants, and operators to form equations, inequalities, and other mathematical statements. By solving equations and inequalities, we can find unknown values and determine whether a statement is true or false.

## B. Overview of Algebraic Notation


### Notation Basics

Algebraic notation is a language used to express mathematical statements and equations. It is composed of symbols that represent operations, numbers, and variables. The most common symbols are:

- **+**: Addition
- **-**: Subtraction
- **\***: Multiplication
- **/**: Division
- **=**: Equals
- **<**: Less than
- **>**: Greater than
- **(**: Left parentheses
- **)**: Right parentheses

These symbols are used to describe relationships between numbers and variables. For example, the equation `5 + 3 = 8` can be written using algebraic notation as `5 + 3 = 8`.

### Variables

Variables are symbols that represent unknown values. In algebraic notation, variables are often represented by letters. For example, the equation `x + 3 = 8` can be written using algebraic notation as `x + 3 = 8`.

Variables can also represent more than one value. For example, the equation `x + y = 8` can be written using algebraic notation as `x + y = 8`.

### Exponents

Exponents are used to represent the number of times a number is multiplied by itself. In algebraic notation, exponents are written as superscripts. For example, the equation `2<sup>3</sup> = 8` can be written using algebraic notation as `2<sup>3</sup> = 8`.

### Order of Operations

When solving equations, it is important to remember the order of operations. This is the sequence in which operations should be performed when solving equations. The order of operations is:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division
4. Addition and Subtraction

For example, the equation `2 + 3 \* 4 = 14` can be written using algebraic notation as `2 + 3 \* 4 = 14`.

### Example Problem

Let's try solving an equation using algebraic notation.

Given the equation `x + 7 = 12`, we can solve for `x` using the order of operations. First, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

`x + 7 - 7 = 12 - 7`

`x = 5`

So, the solution to the equation `x + 7 = 12` is `x = 5`.

### Practice Problems

Try solving the following equations using algebraic notation:

1. `3x + 2 = 14`
2. `5y - 3 = 12`
3. `2<sup>3</sup> + 4 = 16`

Solutions:

1. `3x + 2 = 14`
`3x + 2 - 2 = 14 - 2`
`3x = 12`
`3x / 3 = 12 / 3`
`x = 4`

2. `5y - 3 = 12`
`5y - 3 + 3 = 12 + 3`
`5y = 15`
`5y / 5 = 15 / 5`
`y = 3`

3. `2<sup>3</sup> + 4 = 16`
`2<sup>3</sup> + 4 - 4 = 16 - 4`
`2<sup>3</sup> = 12`
`2<sup>3</sup> / 2 = 12 / 2`
`2<sup>2</sup> = 6`
`2<sup>2</sup> / 2 = 6 / 2`
`2 = 3`

## C. Types of Algebraic Expressions


### Expressions
An **expression** is a combination of numbers, variables, and operations that can be evaluated to a single numerical value. An expression does not contain an equals sign (=).

For example, the following are all expressions:

- `2 + 4`
- `x + 3`
- `3x - 2y`

### Equations
An **equation** is a statement that two expressions are equal. An equation contains an equals sign (=).

For example, the following are all equations:

- `2 + 4 = 6`
- `x + 3 = 5`
- `3x - 2y = 0`

### Inequalities
An **inequality** is a statement that two expressions are not equal. An inequality contains symbols other than an equals sign. The most common symbols used in inequalities are `<`, `>`, `≤`, and `≥`.

For example, the following are all inequalities:

- `2 + 4 < 6`
- `x + 3 > 5`
- `3x - 2y ≤ 0`

### Practice Problems

1. Evaluate the expression `5x + 3` when `x = 2`.

Answer: `11`

2. Solve the equation `2x + 5 = 17`.

Answer: `x = 6`

3. Solve the inequality `3x - 5 > 10`.

Answer: `x > 5`

## D. Order of Operations


### What is the Order of Operations?
The Order of Operations is a set of rules that dictate the sequence in which operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) should be performed when evaluating an algebraic expression. It is also referred to as the "PEMDAS" rule, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

### Why is the Order of Operations Important?
The Order of Operations is important because it ensures that all algebraic expressions are evaluated in the same way, regardless of who is solving them. Without it, different people could solve the same expression in different ways and get different answers.

### Applying the Order of Operations
When solving an algebraic expression, it is important to follow the Order of Operations in order to get the correct answer. The following steps should be followed when applying the Order of Operations:

1. Simplify any expressions inside parentheses.
2. Evaluate any exponents (powers or roots).
3. Perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.
4. Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.

### Example
Let's look at a simple example to see how the Order of Operations works:

- `2 + 3 × 4`

In this expression, we have an addition and a multiplication. According to the Order of Operations, we should first perform the multiplication, and then the addition. So, the expression should be evaluated as follows:

- `2 + 3 × 4 = 2 + 12 = 14`

### Practice Problems
Now that you understand the Order of Operations, try solving the following practice problems:

1. `4 + 3 × 7`
2. `2 × (4 + 5)`
3. `4(2 + 3)`

Answers:
1. `4 + 3 × 7 = 4 + 21 = 25`
2. `2 × (4 + 5) = 2 × 9 = 18`
3. `4(2 + 3) = 4 × 5 = 20`

## E. Introduction to Variables

### What is a Variable?
A variable is a symbol that stands for an unknown number. It is used to represent a quantity that can change or vary. Variables are often used in algebraic equations or expressions to represent the unknown values that need to be solved for.

### Types of Variables
There are two types of variables: independent and dependent.

**Independent Variables** are the variables that are not affected by other variables in the equation. These are usually the variables that are used to represent the input values of the equation.

**Dependent Variables** are the variables that are affected by other variables in the equation. These are usually the variables that are used to represent the output values of the equation.

### Examples

Let's look at an example of a simple equation:

```js
y = 2x + 3
```

In this equation, `x` is the independent variable and `y` is the dependent variable. This equation can be read as "`y` is equal to `2x` plus `3`".

The value of `y` is dependent on the value of `x`. If `x` is `2`, then `y` is `7` (`2x` + `3` = `7`). If `x` is `4`, then `y` is `11` (`2x` + `3` = `11`).

### Practice Problems

1. What is the independent variable in the equation `y = 5x + 7`?
   - The independent variable in the equation `y = 5x + 7` is `x`.

2. What is the dependent variable in the equation `y = 5x + 7`?
   - The dependent variable in the equation `y = 5x + 7` is `y`.

3. If `x` is `3`, what is the value of `y` in the equation `y = 5x + 7`?
   - If `x` is `3`, the value of `y` in the equation `y = 5x + 7` is `18` (`5x` + `7` = `18`).

## F. Basic Algebraic Rules


### Commutative Property
The Commutative Property states that the order of numbers does not affect the result of an equation. This means that for any two numbers, a and b, the equation a + b = b + a. For example, if you have the equation 2 + 3 = 5, then the equation 3 + 2 = 5 as well.

### Associative Property
The Associative Property states that the grouping of numbers does not affect the result of an equation. This means that for any three numbers, a, b, and c, the equation (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). For example, if you have the equation (2 + 3) + 4 = 9, then the equation 2 + (3 + 4) = 9 as well.

### Distributive Property
The Distributive Property states that a number multiplied by the sum of two numbers is equal to the sum of two numbers multiplied by the first number. This means that for any three numbers, a, b, and c, the equation a(b + c) = ab + ac. For example, if you have the equation 2(3 + 4) = 14, then the equation 2(3) + 2(4) = 14 as well.

### Identity Property
The Identity Property states that any number multiplied by 1 is equal to the original number. This means that for any number, a, the equation a * 1 = a. For example, if you have the equation 3 * 1 = 3, then the equation 3 * 1 = 3 as well.

### Inverse Property
The Inverse Property states that any number multiplied by its inverse (the number that will result in 1 when multiplied) will result in 1. This means that for any number, a, the equation a * 1/a = 1. For example, if you have the equation 4 * 1/4 = 1, then the equation 4 * 1/4 = 1 as well.

### Practice Problems

1. Use the Commutative Property to solve the equation:
    - 6 + 4 =
    - Answer: 10

2. Use the Associative Property to solve the equation:
    - (4 + 5) + 3 =
    - Answer: 12

3. Use the Distributive Property to solve the equation:
    - 4(2 + 3) =
    - Answer: 20

4. Use the Identity Property to solve the equation:
    - 5 * 1 =
    - Answer: 5

5. Use the Inverse Property to solve the equation:
    - 6 * 1/6 =
    - Answer: 1

## G. Solving Algebraic Equations

### Overview

Solving algebraic equations is the process of finding the values of the unknown variables that make the equation true. It is a fundamental skill in algebra and can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.

### Basic Steps

The basic steps to solving an algebraic equation are:

1. Simplify the equation by combining like terms and rearranging the equation
2. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation
3. Solve the equation

For example, consider the equation `2x + 4 = 10`.

1. Simplify the equation by combining like terms: `2x = 6`
2. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation: `2x = 6 → x = 3`
3. Solve the equation: `x = 3`

### Types of Equations

There are several types of equations that can be solved in algebra. The most common are linear equations, quadratic equations, and polynomial equations.

#### Linear Equations

Linear equations are equations of the form `ax + b = c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. They can be solved by isolating the variable on one side of the equation and then solving for the value of the variable.

For example, consider the equation `2x + 4 = 10`.

1. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation: `2x = 6`
2. Solve the equation: `2x = 6 → x = 3`

#### Quadratic Equations

Quadratic equations are equations of the form `ax² + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. They can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is `x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a`.

For example, consider the equation `x² + 5x + 6 = 0`.

1. Plug the values into the quadratic formula: `x = (-5 ± √(5² - 4(1)(6))) / 2(1)`
2. Solve the equation: `x = (-5 ± √(-19)) / 2 → x = -2 or x = 3`

#### Polynomial Equations

Polynomial equations are equations of the form `axⁿ + bxⁿ⁻¹ + ... + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, ..., and `c` are constants. They can be solved using a variety of methods, such as factoring and the quadratic formula.

For example, consider the equation `x³ - 3x² + 4x - 12 = 0`.

1. Factor the equation: `(x - 3)(x² + x - 4) = 0`
2. Solve the equation: `x - 3 = 0 → x = 3` and `x² + x - 4 = 0 → x = -1 or x = 4`

### Summary

Solving algebraic equations is a fundamental skill in algebra. There are several types of equations that can be solved, including linear equations, quadratic equations, and polynomial equations. The basic steps to solving an algebraic equation are to simplify the equation, isolate the variable on one side of the equation, and then solve the equation.

## H. Applications of Algebra


### Introduction
Algebra is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. Algebra can be used to solve equations, graph functions, solve for unknown values, and more. In this section, we will explore some of the practical applications of algebra.

### Equations
One of the most common applications of algebra is solving equations. Equations are mathematical statements that use an equal sign to show that two expressions are equal. For example, the equation `2x + 3 = 7` can be used to find the value of `x`. By solving this equation, we can determine that `x = 2`.

### Graphing
Algebra can also be used to graph equations. Graphing equations can help us visualize the relationship between two variables. For example, the equation `y = 2x + 1` can be graphed to show the relationship between `x` and `y`.

### Unknown Values
Algebra can also be used to find unknown values. For example, if we have an equation such as `x + y = 10`, we can use algebra to find the values of `x` and `y`. By solving the equation, we can determine that `x = 5` and `y = 5`.

### Applications in Science
Algebra is also used in a variety of scientific fields. For example, algebra can be used to calculate the velocity of a moving object, calculate the area of a circle, or find the volume of a cylinder. Algebra can also be used to solve for unknowns in physics equations, such as finding the acceleration of an object given its mass and force.

### Applications in Business
Algebra can also be used in business applications. For example, algebra can be used to calculate the cost of a product given its cost and profit margin, calculate the total cost of a project given the cost of each individual item, or calculate the interest rate on a loan.

### Summary
Algebra is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. Algebra can be used to solve equations, graph functions, solve for unknown values, and more. Algebra is also used in a variety of scientific and business applications. With the right knowledge and practice, algebra can be a powerful tool for problem solving.

## I. Algebraic Problem Solving Strategies


### Analyzing the Problem

The first step to solving an algebraic problem is to carefully read and analyze the problem. This involves understanding what the problem is asking and what information is given. It is important to note any constraints or conditions given in the problem.

For example, consider the following problem:

> Find the value of x if 5x + 3 = 21

The first step is to identify the unknown variable (in this case, x). Then, identify the given information (in this case, 5x + 3 = 21).

### Formulating a Plan

Once you have identified the unknown and given information, you can begin to formulate a plan for solving the problem. This involves deciding which operations to use in order to isolate the unknown variable and solve for its value.

In the example problem, you can see that the goal is to isolate the x variable. To do this, you will need to use the inverse operation of addition, which is subtraction.

### Executing the Plan

Once you have formulated a plan, you can begin to execute it. This involves performing the necessary operations in order to solve for the unknown variable.

In the example problem, you can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the x variable:

5x + 3 = 21
-3 -3
5x = 18

Then, you can divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

5x = 18
/5 /5
x = 3.6

### Verifying the Solution

The last step is to verify the solution. This involves plugging the value of the unknown variable back into the original equation to check that it is correct.

In the example problem, plugging in x = 3.6 yields:

5(3.6) + 3 = 21
18 + 3 = 21

Since 18 + 3 = 21, the solution is verified.

## J. Summary

# 2. Basic Algebraic Operations


## A. Addition and Subtraction of Algebraic Expressions


### Adding and Subtracting Algebraic Expressions

Algebraic expressions can be added and subtracted just like regular numbers. The only difference is that instead of dealing with numbers, we are dealing with variables and coefficients. To add or subtract algebraic expressions, we simply combine like terms.

#### Like Terms

Like terms are terms that have the same variable and the same exponent. For example, the terms 3x<sup>2</sup> and 4x<sup>2</sup> are like terms because they both have the same variable (x) and the same exponent (2).

#### Combining Like Terms

To combine like terms, we simply add or subtract the coefficients of the like terms. For example, if we have the expression 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x<sup>2</sup>, we can combine the terms by adding the coefficients to get 7x<sup>2</sup>.

#### Examples

1. Simplify the expression 5x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 6x<sup>2</sup>.

- First, we combine the like terms 5x<sup>2</sup> and 6x<sup>2</sup> to get 11x<sup>2</sup>.

- Then, we combine the remaining terms 4x and 11x<sup>2</sup> to get 11x<sup>2</sup> + 4x.

- Therefore, the simplified expression is 11x<sup>2</sup> + 4x.

2. Simplify the expression 5x<sup>2</sup> - 2x<sup>2</sup> + 4x - 8x<sup>2</sup>.

- First, we combine the like terms 5x<sup>2</sup> and 8x<sup>2</sup> to get -3x<sup>2</sup>.

- Then, we combine the remaining terms 2x<sup>2</sup> and 4x to get -3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x.

- Therefore, the simplified expression is -3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x.

#### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the expression 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 5x<sup>2</sup>.

2. Simplify the expression 7x<sup>2</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 4x<sup>2</sup>.

## B. Multiplication of Algebraic Expressions

### Introduction

Multiplication of algebraic expressions is one of the most important operations in algebra. It is used to combine two or more terms into a single expression. It is also used to solve equations and simplify expressions.

### Basic Multiplication

The basic rule for multiplying two algebraic expressions is to multiply each term in one expression by each term in the other expression. This can be done by using the distributive property.

For example, to multiply the expressions `3x + 2y` and `4x - 5y`, we can use the distributive property to get:

```
(3x + 2y) * (4x - 5y)
= (3x * 4x) + (3x * -5y) + (2y * 4x) + (2y * -5y)
= 12x^2 - 15xy - 8xy - 10y^2
= 12x^2 - 23xy - 10y^2
```

### Multiplication of Monomials

When multiplying monomials, the result is a new monomial with a product of the numerical coefficients and a product of the literal coefficients.

For example, to multiply `2x^2` and `3x`, we can use the basic multiplication rule to get:

`2x^2 * 3x = 6x^3`

### Multiplication of Polynomials

When multiplying polynomials, the result is a new polynomial with a product of the numerical coefficients and a product of the literal coefficients.

For example, to multiply `2x^2 + 3x + 4` and `3x^2 - 5x + 2`, we can use the basic multiplication rule to get:

```
(2x^2 + 3x + 4) * (3x^2 - 5x + 2)
= (2x^2 * 3x^2) + (2x^2 * -5x) + (2x^2 * 2) + (3x * 3x^2) + (3x * -5x) + (3x * 2) + (4 * 3x^2) + (4 * -5x) + (4 * 2)
= 6x^4 - 10x^3 + 4x^2 - 15x^2 + 6x + 8x - 10x + 8
= 6x^4 - 25x^3 + 10x^2 + 8
```

### Practice Problems

1. Multiply `3x^2 + 2x - 5` and `4x + 7`.

```
(3x^2 + 2x - 5) * (4x + 7)
= (3x^2 * 4x) + (3x^2 * 7) + (2x * 4x) + (2x * 7) + (-5 * 4x) + (-5 * 7)
= 12x^3 + 21x^2 + 8x - 35
```

2. Multiply `2x^3 - 7x` and `3x + 4`.

```
(2x^3 - 7x) * (3x + 4)
= (2x^3 * 3x) + (2x^3 * 4) + (-7x * 3x) + (-7x * 4)
= 6x^4 + 8x^3 - 21x^2 - 28x
```

3. Multiply `3x^2 - 4x + 7` and `x^3 - 2x + 3`.

```
(3x^2 - 4x + 7) * (x^3 - 2x + 3)
= (3x^2 * x^3) + (3x^2 * -2x) + (3x^2 * 3) + (-4x * x^3) + (-4x * -2x) + (-4x * 3) + (7 * x^3) + (7 * -2x) + (7 * 3)
= 3x^5 - 6x^4 + 9x^3 - 8x^2 + 21x - 21
```

## C. Division of Algebraic Expressions

### Basic Division

Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. Therefore, when we divide algebraic expressions, we are essentially undoing the multiplication that was done. We can think of division as equal groups or as fractions.

For example, if we divide `a` by `b`, it can be written as:

`a/b`

or

`a ÷ b`

or

`a ÷ b = c`

where `c` is the result of the division.

In algebraic expressions, the division is done in the same way. For example, if we divide `2x` by `x`, we get `2`.

`2x ÷ x = 2`

We can also divide algebraic expressions with more than one term. For example, if we divide `3x + 5` by `x`, we get `3 + 5/x`.

`3x + 5 ÷ x = 3 + 5/x`

### Dividing Monomials

When we divide monomials, we are essentially dividing each term in the monomial by the divisor. For example, if we divide `2x^2y` by `x`, we get `2xy`.

`2x^2y ÷ x = 2xy`

We can also divide monomials with more than one term. For example, if we divide `3x^2y + 5x` by `x`, we get `3xy + 5`.

`3x^2y + 5x ÷ x = 3xy + 5`

### Dividing Polynomials

When we divide polynomials, we are essentially dividing each term in the polynomial by the divisor. For example, if we divide `4x^2 + 3x + 2` by `2x`, we get `2x + 3/2 + 1/x`.

`4x^2 + 3x + 2 ÷ 2x = 2x + 3/2 + 1/x`

We can also divide polynomials with more than one term. For example, if we divide `3x^2 + 5x + 7` by `x + 1`, we get `3x + 5 - 7/x + 1`.

`3x^2 + 5x + 7 ÷ (x + 1) = 3x + 5 - 7/x + 1`

### Practice Problems

1. Divide `6x + 4` by `2x`.

`6x + 4 ÷ 2x = 3 + 2/x`

2. Divide `4x^2 + 5x` by `x`.

`4x^2 + 5x ÷ x = 4x + 5`

3. Divide `3x^2 + 7x + 5` by `2x + 1`.

`3x^2 + 7x + 5 ÷ (2x + 1) = 3x + 7 - 5/2x + 1`

## D. Exponents and Roots


### Exponents

Exponents are shorthand for repeated multiplication. In algebra, we use exponents to represent repeated multiplication of the same number. For example, the expression `3^2` means "3 multiplied by itself 2 times". In other words, it means 3x3, which is 9.

The base number is written first, followed by the exponent, which is written as a small, raised number. The exponent tells us how many times the base number is multiplied by itself.

We can also use exponents to represent very large numbers. For example, `10^6` means 10 multiplied by itself 6 times, which is 1,000,000.

We can also use negative exponents. For example, `2^-3` means 1 divided by 2 multiplied by itself 3 times, which is 1/8.

### Roots

Roots are the opposite of exponents. In algebra, we use roots to represent the inverse of an exponent. For example, the expression `√9` means "the number that when multiplied by itself will give us 9". In other words, it means 3.

The number inside the radical symbol is written first, followed by the root, which is written as a small, raised number. The root tells us how many times the number inside the radical symbol is multiplied by itself.

We can also use roots to represent fractions. For example, `√2/3` means the number that when multiplied by itself will give us 2, divided by 3. In other words, it means the square root of 2 divided by 3, which is 0.816.

We can also use fractional exponents, which are equivalent to roots. For example, `2^(1/3)` means the number that when multiplied by itself 3 times will give us 2. In other words, it means the cube root of 2, which is 1.259.

### Practice Problems

6. Simplify the expression `2^(1/3)`

- Answer: 1.259

## E. Order of Operations


### Introduction to Order of Operations

Order of operations is an important concept in algebra that helps us solve equations and simplify expressions. It is a set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform operations when solving equations or simplifying expressions. The order of operations is often abbreviated as PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.

### The Rules of Order of Operations

The rules of order of operations are as follows:

1. Parentheses: Any operations inside parentheses should be done first.
2. Exponents: Any operations involving exponents should be done second.
3. Multiplication and Division: Any operations involving multiplication and division should be done in order from left to right.
4. Addition and Subtraction: Any operations involving addition and subtraction should be done in order from left to right.

### Examples

Let's look at a few examples to illustrate the order of operations.

1. Simplify the expression `2 + 3 * 4`.

Using the order of operations, we first do the multiplication, `3 * 4 = 12`, and then the addition, `2 + 12 = 14`. So the answer is `14`.

2. Simplify the expression `(2 + 3) * 4`.

Using the order of operations, we first do the parentheses, `2 + 3 = 5`, and then the multiplication, `5 * 4 = 20`. So the answer is `20`.

3. Simplify the expression `2^3 * 4`.

Using the order of operations, we first do the exponents, `2^3 = 8`, and then the multiplication, `8 * 4 = 32`. So the answer is `32`.

4. Simplify the expression `2 + 3^2`.

Using the order of operations, we first do the exponents, `3^2 = 9`, and then the addition, `2 + 9 = 11`. So the answer is `11`.

### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the expression `2 * 5 + 3`.

2. Simplify the expression `(3 + 5)^2`.

3. Simplify the expression `3 * (4 + 5)`.

4. Simplify the expression `2^2 + 4^2`.

## F. Combining Like Terms


### Introduction

Combining like terms is an important algebraic operation that allows us to simplify expressions and equations. In order to combine like terms, we must first identify the terms that are "like" each other. Like terms are terms that contain the same variables raised to the same powers. For example, the terms 4x<sup>2</sup> and -2x<sup>2</sup> are like terms because they both contain the same variable (x) raised to the same power (2).

### Combining Like Terms

The process of combining like terms is relatively straightforward. To combine like terms, we simply add or subtract the coefficients of the terms. For example, consider the expression 4x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 2x<sup>2</sup>. In this expression, the terms 4x<sup>2</sup> and -2x<sup>2</sup> are like terms, so we can combine them by adding the coefficients:

4x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 2x<sup>2</sup> = (4 + -2)x<sup>2</sup> + 6x = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 6x

We can also combine like terms that are multiplied together. For example, consider the expression 2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> - 4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>. In this expression, the terms 2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> and -4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> are like terms, so we can combine them by adding the coefficients:

2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> - 4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> = (2 + -4)x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> = -2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>

### Examples

Let's look at a few examples of combining like terms.

**Example 1**

Simplify the expression 5x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 3x<sup>2</sup>.

Solution: 5x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 3x<sup>2</sup> = (5 - 3)x<sup>2</sup> + 6x = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 6x

**Example 2**

Simplify the expression 3x<sup>2</sup>y + 4x<sup>2</sup>y - 2xy.

Solution: 3x<sup>2</sup>y + 4x<sup>2</sup>y - 2xy = (3 + 4)x<sup>2</sup>y - 2xy = 7x<sup>2</sup>y - 2xy

### Practice Problems

Try the following practice problems to test your knowledge of combining like terms.

1. Simplify the expression 3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x - 2x<sup>2</sup>.

2. Simplify the expression 4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>.

3. Simplify the expression 8x<sup>2</sup>y + 2xy - 4x<sup>2</sup>y.

### Answers

1. 3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x - 2x<sup>2</sup> = (3 - 2)x<sup>2</sup> + 5x = x<sup>2</sup> + 5x
2. 4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> = (4 - 6)x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> = -2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>
3. 8x<sup>2</sup>y + 2xy - 4x<sup>2</sup>y = (8 + 2)x<sup>2</sup>y - 4x<sup>2</sup>y = 10x<sup>2</sup>y - 4x<sup>2</sup>y

## G. Simplifying Algebraic Expressions


### What is Simplifying?

Simplifying an algebraic expression is the process of combining like terms and removing any unnecessary factors or operations. This process can be used to reduce a complex expression to its simplest form.

### How to Simplify

When simplifying an expression, there are a few steps to follow:

1. Combine like terms:
   - Look for terms that have the same variable, coefficient, and exponent and combine them.
   - For example, if you have `2x^2 + 3x^2`, combine them to get `5x^2`.
2. Remove parentheses:
   - If there are any parentheses, remove them and distribute the coefficient or exponent to the terms inside.
   - For example, if you have `2(x+3)`, remove the parentheses to get `2x + 6`.
3. Factor out common factors:
   - If there are any common factors, factor them out and put them in front of the expression.
   - For example, if you have `2x^2 + 4x`, factor out the common factor of `2` to get `2(x^2 + 2x)`.
4. Simplify exponents:
   - If there are any exponents, simplify them using the rules of exponents.
   - For example, if you have `x^2 * x^3`, simplify the exponents to get `x^5`.

### Examples

Let's take a look at some examples of simplifying expressions:

**Example 1**

Simplify `2x^2 + 3x + 5x^2`.

Solution:

Combine like terms: `2x^2 + 5x^2 = 7x^2`.

Remove parentheses: No parentheses, so nothing to do here.

Factor out common factors: No common factors, so nothing to do here.

Simplify exponents: No exponents, so nothing to do here.

Final answer: `7x^2 + 3x`.

**Example 2**

Simplify `2(x + 3) + 4x^2`.

Solution:

Combine like terms: No like terms, so nothing to do here.

Remove parentheses: `2x + 6 + 4x^2`.

Factor out common factors: No common factors, so nothing to do here.

Answers:

1. `2x^2 + 5x`
2. `2x + 12 + 3x^2`
3. `5x^2 + 3x`

## H. Solving Multi-Step Equations


### Definition
A multi-step equation is an equation that requires more than one step to solve. It may involve combining like terms, taking the inverse of both sides of the equation, or using the distributive property.

### Examples
Here are some examples of multi-step equations:

1. 4x + 7 = 11
2. 3x + 2 = 11
3. 2x + 5 - 3x = 18
4. 2x - 5 + 7x = -3

### Solving Multi-Step Equations
The steps for solving multi-step equations are as follows:

1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms.
2. Use inverse operations to isolate the variable.
3. Solve the equation.

Let's look at the first example: 4x + 7 = 11

1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms: 4x + 7 = 11
2. Use inverse operations to isolate the variable: 4x + 7 - 7 = 11 - 7
3. Solve the equation: 4x = 4
4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable: x = 1

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the equation: 5x + 4 = 11

  1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms: 5x + 4 = 11
  2. Use inverse operations to isolate the variable: 5x + 4 - 4 = 11 - 4
  3. Solve the equation: 5x = 7
  4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable: x = 1.4

2. Solve the equation: 3x - 7 = 18

  1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms: 3x - 7 = 18
  2. Use inverse operations to isolate the variable: 3x - 7 + 7 = 18 + 7
  3. Solve the equation: 3x = 25
  4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable: x = 8.33

## I. Solving Inequalities


### Introduction

Inequalities are mathematical expressions that involve the comparison of two values. These expressions can be written in the form of an equation, with the inequality symbol replacing the equals sign. Inequalities can be used to determine whether or not a given value is greater than, less than, or equal to another value.

### Types of Inequalities

There are four types of inequalities:

- **Greater than:** `a > b` means that a is greater than b.

- **Less than:** `a < b` means that a is less than b.

- **Greater than or equal to:** `a >= b` means that a is greater than or equal to b.

- **Less than or equal to:** `a <= b` means that a is less than or equal to b.

### Solving Inequalities

Solving inequalities is similar to solving equations, except that the inequality symbol must be taken into account.

#### Addition and Subtraction

When adding or subtracting a value from both sides of an inequality, the inequality symbol remains unchanged.

For example, if we are given the inequality `x + 2 > 5`, we can subtract 2 from both sides to get `x > 3`.

#### Multiplication and Division

When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a positive value, the inequality symbol remains unchanged.

For example, if we are given the inequality `2x < 10`, we can divide both sides by 2 to get `x < 5`.

When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative value, the inequality symbol is reversed.

For example, if we are given the inequality `x > 8`, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get `-x < -8`.

#### Solving Inequalities with Variables on Both Sides

When solving an inequality with variables on both sides, we must isolate the variable on one side. This is done by performing the same operations on both sides of the inequality.

For example, if we are given the inequality `4x + 2 > 10`, we can subtract 2 from both sides to get `4x > 8`. We can then divide both sides by 4 to get `x > 2`.

### Graphing Inequalities

Inequalities can be graphed on a number line or a coordinate plane. When graphing an inequality on a number line, the inequality symbol is used to indicate which side of the line contains the solution.

For example, if we are given the inequality `x > 2`, we can graph it on a number line by drawing an arrow pointing to the right at 2, indicating that all values greater than 2 are part of the solution.

When graphing an inequality on a coordinate plane, the solution is represented by a shaded region. The inequality symbol is used to determine which side of the line is shaded.

For example, if we are given the inequality `y ≥ 2`, we can graph it on a coordinate plane by shading the region above the line, indicating that all values greater than or equal to 2 are part of the solution.

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the inequality `3x + 5 > 12`.

Answer: `x > 3`

2. Graph the inequality `x < -2` on a number line.

Answer: ![Number Line](https://i.imgur.com/PZoUd7p.png)

3. Graph the inequality `y > -3` on a coordinate plane.

# 3. Algebraic Equations


## A. Definition of an Algebraic Equation

### What is an Algebraic Equation?
An algebraic equation is a mathematical equation involving one or more variables. A variable is a symbol, usually a letter, that stands for an unknown quantity. Algebraic equations are used to describe relationships between variables and to solve for unknown values.

### Types of Algebraic Equations
Algebraic equations can be divided into two categories: linear equations and nonlinear equations.

#### Linear Equations
Linear equations are equations in which the highest degree of the variable is one. This means that the equation will not contain any terms with exponents greater than one. Examples of linear equations include:

- 2x + 3 = 5
- 3y - 7 = 11
- x + y = 5

#### Nonlinear Equations
Nonlinear equations are equations in which the highest degree of the variable is greater than one. This means that the equation will contain terms with exponents greater than one. Examples of nonlinear equations include:

- x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1 = 0
- y<sup>3</sup> - 5y<sup>2</sup> + 2y + 7 = 0
- 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4y<sup>2</sup> + 5 = 0

### Solving Algebraic Equations
The goal of solving an algebraic equation is to find the value or values of the variable that make the equation true. This can be done by using various techniques, such as the distributive property, inverse operations, substitution, and the quadratic formula.

#### Example
Let's look at an example of solving an algebraic equation. Consider the equation x + 3 = 7. To solve this equation, we need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.

We can solve this equation by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

x + 3 = 7
-3 -3
x = 4

Therefore, the value of x that makes the equation true is 4.

#### Practice Problems
1. Solve the equation 2x + 1 = 5.
2. Solve the equation y<sup>2</sup> + 3y - 4 = 0.
3. Solve the equation 4x - 2 = 10.

#### Answers
1. x = 2
2. y = 1 or y = -4
3. x = 6

## B. Types of Algebraic Equations

### Linear Equations
Linear equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `ax + b = 0`, where `a` and `b` are constants and `x` is a variable. A linear equation can have any number of terms, but all terms must be of the same degree (or power) of the variable. For example, the equation `2x + 3 = 5` is a linear equation, while `2x^2 + 3 = 5` is not.

Linear equations can be solved using a variety of methods, including graphing, substitution, and elimination. Graphing can be used when the equation is written in the form `y = mx + b`, where `m` and `b` are constants. Substitution is used when one of the variables can be isolated and solved for. Elimination is used when two equations are combined to eliminate one of the variables.

### Quadratic Equations
Quadratic equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants and `x` is a variable. A quadratic equation can have any number of terms, but all terms must be of the same degree (or power) of the variable. For example, the equation `2x^2 + 3x + 5 = 0` is a quadratic equation, while `2x^3 + 3x + 5 = 0` is not.

Quadratic equations can be solved using a variety of methods, including factoring, graphing, and the quadratic formula. Factoring is used when the equation can be factored into two linear equations. Graphing can be used when the equation is written in the form `y = ax^2 + bx + c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. The quadratic formula is used when the equation cannot be factored and must be solved using an algebraic method.

### Polynomial Equations
Polynomial equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants and `x` is a variable. A polynomial equation can have any number of terms, but all terms must be of the same degree (or power) of the variable. For example, the equation `2x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7 = 0` is a polynomial equation, while `2x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x^(1/2) + 7 = 0` is not.

Polynomial equations can be solved using a variety of methods, including factoring, graphing, and the quadratic formula. Factoring is used when the equation can be factored into linear or quadratic equations. Graphing can be used when the equation is written in the form `y = ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. The quadratic formula is used when the equation cannot be factored and must be solved using an algebraic method.

### Rational Equations
Rational equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `p(x)/q(x) = 0`, where `p(x)` and `q(x)` are polynomial equations. A rational equation can have any number of terms, but all terms must be polynomials. For example, the equation `2x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7 / (x^2 + 1) = 0` is a rational equation, while `2x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7 / (x^2 + x + 1) = 0` is not.

Rational equations can be solved using a variety of methods, including factoring, graphing, and the quadratic formula. Factoring is used when the equation can be factored into linear, quadratic, or polynomial equations. Graphing can be used when the equation is written in the form `y = p(x)/q(x)`, where `p(x)` and `q(x)` are polynomial equations. The quadratic formula is used when the equation cannot be factored and must be solved using an algebraic method.

### Radical Equations
Radical equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `

## C. Simplifying Algebraic Equations


### What is Simplifying?

Simplifying an algebraic equation is the process of rewriting a given equation in a simpler form. This process is also referred to as "reducing" or "simplifying an expression". It involves rearranging the terms of the equation and combining like terms.

### Examples

Let's start with a simple example. Consider the equation:

```
2x + 3 - x = 5
```

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

```
2x + 3 - x = 5
2x + 3 - 3 = 5
2x = 2
x = 1
```

In this example, we combined the two x terms and the three terms to get the simplified equation.

Now let's look at a more complex example. Consider the equation:

```
2x + 5y - 3x + 4y = 6
```

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

```
2x + 5y - 3x + 4y = 6
2x - 3x + 5y + 4y = 6
-x + 9y = 6
x = 6 - 9y
```

In this example, we combined the two x terms and the two y terms to get the simplified equation.

### Practice

Now that you've seen some examples of simplifying equations, let's try some practice problems.

1. Simplify the equation:

```
3x + 4y - 2x + 7y = 10
```

Answer:
```
3x + 4y - 2x + 7y = 10
1x + 11y = 10
x = 10 - 11y
```

2. Simplify the equation:

```
2x + 3y - y + 5x = 7
```

Answer:
```
2x + 3y - y + 5x = 7
2x + 2y + 5x = 7
7x + 2y = 7
x = 7 - 2y/7
```

## D. Solving Algebraic Equations


### Introduction
Solving algebraic equations is an important skill in algebra. An algebraic equation is an equation that contains one or more terms that involve a variable. Solving an equation means finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true. In this section we will discuss how to solve algebraic equations.

### Basic Steps
The basic steps for solving an algebraic equation are as follows:

1. Simplify the equation by combining like terms and/or using the distributive property.
2. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
3. Solve the equation.

### Simplifying the Equation
The first step in solving an algebraic equation is to simplify the equation by combining like terms and/or using the distributive property. For example, consider the following equation:

```
2x + 5 = 7x – 3
```

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms and using the distributive property:

```
2x + 5 = 7x – 3
2x + 7x = 5 + 3
9x = 8
x = 8/9
```

### Isolating the Variable
The second step in solving an algebraic equation is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. This is done by using inverse operations. Inverse operations are operations that “undo” each other. The inverse of addition is subtraction, and the inverse of multiplication is division.

For example, consider the equation:

```
2x + 5 = 7x – 3
```

We can isolate the variable by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

```
2x + 5 - 5 = 7x – 3 - 5
2x = 7x – 8
2x - 7x = -8
-5x = -8
x = 8/5
```

### Solving the Equation
The third and final step in solving an algebraic equation is to solve the equation. This is done by substituting the value of the variable into the equation and solving for the unknown.

For example, consider the equation:

```
2x + 5 = 7x – 3
```

We can solve this equation by substituting 8/5 for x and solving for the unknown:

```
2(8/5) + 5 = 7(8/5) – 3
16/5 + 5 = 56/5 – 3
21/5 = 53/5
21/5 - 53/5 = 0
0 = 0
```

### Practice Problems
Now that we have discussed how to solve algebraic equations, let's practice with some examples.

1. Solve the following equation:

```
4x + 7 = 3x + 15
```

Solution:

We can solve this equation by isolating the variable on one side of the equation:

```
4x + 7 = 3x + 15
4x - 3x = 15 - 7
x = 8
```

2. Solve the following equation:

```
2x + 3 = 7x – 4
```

Solution:

We can solve this equation by isolating the variable on one side of the equation:

```
2x + 3 = 7x – 4
2x - 7x = -4 - 3
-5x = -7
x = 7/5
```

## E. Using the Distributive Property


### What is the Distributive Property?

The distributive property is an important tool in algebra that allows us to simplify and manipulate equations. It states that when a number is multiplied by a group of terms, the number can be distributed to each term in the group. This means that the number can be multiplied by each term separately, and then the results can be added together.

For example, if we have the equation:

```
2x(x + 3)
```

Using the distributive property, we can rewrite this equation as:

```
2x * x + 2x * 3
```

Which can then be simplified to:

```
2x² + 6x
```

### Examples of the Distributive Property

The distributive property can be used to simplify and solve many equations. Here are a few examples of how it can be used:

- **Simplifying equations:**

For example, if we have the equation:

```
2(x + 3) + 4(x + 3)
```

We can use the distributive property to simplify it to:

```
2x + 6 + 4x + 12
```

Which can then be simplified to:

```
6x + 18
```

- **Solving equations:**

The distributive property can also be used to solve equations. For example, if we have the equation:

```
2x + 3 = 15
```

We can use the distributive property to solve it by first subtracting 3 from both sides:

```
2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3
```

Which simplifies to:

```
2x = 12
```

Then, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

```
2x/2 = 12/2
```

Which simplifies to:

```
x = 6
```

### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the equation `3(x + 4) - 5(x + 4)`

Answer: `-2x - 8`

2. Solve the equation `3x + 9 = 24`

Answer: `x = 7`

3. Simplify the equation `2(2x + 3) + 3(2x + 3)`

Answer: `5x + 9`

## F. Using the Order of Operations

### What is the Order of Operations?
The Order of Operations is the set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform calculations when solving an algebraic equation. It is also commonly referred to as PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

### Why is the Order of Operations Important?
The Order of Operations is important because it ensures that we get the correct answer when solving an equation. Without following the Order of Operations, we may get an incorrect answer.

### How is the Order of Operations Used?
The Order of Operations is used when solving algebraic equations. It tells us the order in which to perform the operations, such as multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.

### Examples
Let's look at a few examples of using the Order of Operations to solve algebraic equations.

- Example 1: Solve the equation: 2 + 3 * 4

In this equation, we should first do the multiplication (3 * 4) before the addition (2 +). The answer is 14.

- Example 2: Solve the equation: (2 + 3) * 4

In this equation, we should first do the addition (2 + 3) before the multiplication (* 4). The answer is 20.

- Example 3: Solve the equation: 4 + 2 * 3 - 6

In this equation, we should first do the multiplication (2 * 3) before the addition (4 +). Then, we should do the subtraction (6 -) after the addition. The answer is 4.

### Practice Problems
Now let's practice using the Order of Operations to solve some equations.

1. Solve the equation: 5 + 7 * 2

Answer: 19

2. Solve the equation: (4 + 6) * 3

Answer: 42

3. Solve the equation: 8 - 4 * 3 + 2

Answer: 2

## G. Using Algebraic Identities

### What are Algebraic Identities?
Algebraic identities are equations that are true for all values of their variables. They are also known as “equational identities” or “identity equations” and are used to simplify equations.

### Types of Algebraic Identities
There are several types of algebraic identities, including:
- **Commutative Property**: This states that the order of the terms in a mathematical expression does not matter. For example, a + b = b + a.
- **Associative Property**: This states that the order in which operations are performed does not matter. For example, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
- **Distributive Property**: This states that when two numbers are multiplied together, the product is equal to the sum of the individual products of each number. For example, a(b + c) = ab + ac.
- **Identity Property**: This states that any number multiplied by one is equal to itself. For example, a * 1 = a.
- **Inverse Property**: This states that any number divided by itself is equal to one. For example, a/a = 1.
- **Zero Property**: This states that any number multiplied by zero is equal to zero. For example, a * 0 = 0.

### Examples
Let's look at some examples of how to use algebraic identities to simplify equations.

**Example 1**: Simplify the equation 4x + 5 + 2x.

Using the commutative property, we can rearrange the terms in the equation:

4x + 2x + 5 = (4x + 2x) + 5 = 6x + 5

**Example 2**: Simplify the equation (4x + 5) + (2x + 3).

Using the associative property, we can rearrange the terms in the equation:

(4x + 5) + (2x + 3) = 4x + (5 + 2x) + 3 = 4x + (2x + 5) + 3 = 4x + 7 + 3 = 4x + 10

### Practice Problems
1. Simplify the equation a + b + c + d.

Using the commutative property, we can rearrange the terms in the equation:

a + b + c + d = a + c + b + d = a + c + d + b = (a + c) + (b + d) = (a + b) + (c + d)

2. Simplify the equation (3x + 4) + (2x + 5).

Using the associative property, we can rearrange the terms in the equation:

(3x + 4) + (2x + 5) = 3x + (4 + 2x) + 5 = 3x + (2x + 4) + 5 = 3x + 6 + 5 = 3x + 11

## H. Using Inverse Operations


### What Are Inverse Operations?
Inverse operations are mathematical operations that undo one another. For example, addition and subtraction are inverse operations because if you add a number to a given number and then subtract the same number, you will end up with the original number. Similarly, multiplication and division are inverse operations because if you multiply a number by a given number and then divide the result by the same number, you will end up with the original number.

### Using Inverse Operations
Inverse operations are useful for solving equations because they allow you to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. For example, if you have an equation such as `2x + 4 = 10`, you can use inverse operations to isolate the variable `x` on one side of the equation. To do this, you would subtract 4 from both sides of the equation, which would give you `2x = 6`. Then, you could divide both sides of the equation by 2, which would give you `x = 3`.

### Examples

Here are some examples of using inverse operations to solve equations:

**Example 1**

Solve the equation `3x – 2 = 14`

Solution:

1. Add 2 to both sides of the equation: `3x = 16`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: `x = 16/3`
3. Simplify: `x = 5.33`

**Example 2**

Solve the equation `4x + 6 = 10`

Solution:

1. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: `4x = 4`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 4: `x = 4/4`
3. Simplify: `x = 1`

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the equation `5x – 3 = 22`
2. Solve the equation `7x + 8 = 34`
3. Solve the equation `2x + 6 = 16`

### Solutions

1. Add 3 to both sides of the equation: `5x = 25`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 5: `x = 25/5`
3. Simplify: `x = 5`

2. Solution:

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: `7x = 26`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 7: `x = 26/7`
3. Simplify: `x = 3.71`

3. Solution:

1. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: `2x = 10`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: `x = 10/2`
3. Simplify: `x = 5`

## I. Using Substitution

### Overview

Substitution is a method of solving an equation by replacing a variable with a known value. This method can be used to solve equations with one or more variables, and can be used in combination with other methods such as factoring or the quadratic formula.

### Examples

Let's look at a few examples of how substitution can be used to solve equations.

**Example 1**

Solve for x:

$$2x+3=7$$

We can use substitution to solve this equation. First, we need to find a value for x that we can substitute into the equation. Let's use the value x=2. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$2(2)+3=7$$

We can simplify this equation to get the solution:

$$4+3=7$$

Therefore, x=2 is the solution to the equation.

**Example 2**

Solve for y:

$$y+3=8$$

We can use substitution to solve this equation. First, we need to find a value for y that we can substitute into the equation. Let's use the value y=5. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$5+3=8$$

We can simplify this equation to get the solution:

$$5+3=8$$

Therefore, y=5 is the solution to the equation.

### Practice Problems

Now that you've seen a few examples of how substitution can be used to solve equations, let's try some practice problems.

**Problem 1**

Solve for x:

$$x-2=4$$

**Solution**

We can use substitution to solve this equation. First, we need to find a value for x that we can substitute into the equation. Let's use the value x=6. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$6-2=4$$

We can simplify this equation to get the solution:

$$6-2=4$$

Therefore, x=6 is the solution to the equation.

**Problem 2**

Solve for y:

$$y+5=12$$

**Solution**

We can use substitution to solve this equation. First, we need to find a value for y that we can substitute into the equation. Let's use the value y=7. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$7+5=12$$

We can simplify this equation to get the solution:

$$7+5=12$$

Therefore, y=7 is the solution to the equation.

## J. Using the Quadratic Formula

### Introduction

The quadratic formula is an essential tool for solving any quadratic equation. It is a formula that allows us to solve for the two roots of a quadratic equation, given the equation's coefficients. It is a simple formula that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.

### Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is expressed as:

```
x = (-b ± √b² - 4ac) / 2a
```

Where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. The ± sign indicates that there are two possible solutions, one with the plus sign and one with the minus sign.

### Solving with the Quadratic Formula

To solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, first identify the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`. Then plug them into the formula to calculate the two roots.

For example, consider the equation `2x² + 3x - 5 = 0`. The coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = -5`. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

```
x = (-3 ± √3² - 4(2)(-5)) / 2(2)
  = (-3 ± √39) / 4
  = (-3 ± 6.55) / 4
  = (-0.75, 5.75)
```

So the two roots of the equation are `x = -0.75` and `x = 5.75`.

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the equation `3x² - 5x + 2 = 0` using the quadratic formula.

```
x = (-5 ± √5² - 4(3)(2)) / 2(3)
  = (-5 ± √29) / 6
  = (-5 ± 5.39) / 6
  = (-2.695, 0.695)
```

2. Solve the equation `4x² + 7x + 3 = 0` using the quadratic formula.

```
x = (-7 ± √7² - 4(4)(3)) / 2(4)
  = (-7 ± √61) / 8
  = (-7 ± 7.81) / 8
  = (-3.505, 0.495)
```

# 4. Linear Equations


## A. Definition of a Linear Equation


### What is a Linear Equation?
A linear equation is an equation of the form:

$$ax + b = 0$$

where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $x$ is a variable. This is the standard form of a linear equation.

Linear equations are used to model relationships between two or more variables. These equations can be used to describe a wide variety of situations, such as the distance-time relationship in physics, the supply and demand of a product in economics, or the cost of a service in business.

### Slope-Intercept Form
A linear equation can also be written in the slope-intercept form:

$$y = mx + b$$

where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept.

The slope of a line is the rate of change of the y-values with respect to the x-values. It is the steepness of the line. A positive slope means that the line is rising and a negative slope means that the line is falling.

The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

### Examples

1. $2x + 1 = 0$
2. $y = 5x - 3$

### Practice Problems

1. Write the equation $y = -\frac{3}{4}x + 2$ in standard form.

Answer: $-\frac{3}{4}x + y = 2$

2. Find the slope and y-intercept of the equation $y = -3x + 7$.

Answer: Slope = -3, y-intercept = 7

## B. Slope-Intercept Form of a Linear Equation


### Introduction

The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is one of the most commonly used forms for linear equations. It is written in the form:

$$ y = mx + b $$

Where **m** is the slope of the line, and **b** is the y-intercept of the line. The slope-intercept form makes it easy to identify the slope and y-intercept of a line, and it is useful for graphing linear equations.

### Slope

The slope of a line is a measure of its steepness, or how much it rises or falls for each unit it moves. It is calculated by taking two points on the line, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, and using the following formula:

$$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$

The slope of a line can be positive, negative, zero, or undefined.

### Y-Intercept

The y-intercept of a line is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. To find the y-intercept of a line, simply plug in **x** = 0 into the equation and solve for **y**.

### Graphing

To graph a line in slope-intercept form, first identify the slope and y-intercept of the line. Then, plot the y-intercept on the y-axis. From this point, use the slope to find a second point on the line. Connect the two points with a straight line.

### Example

Let's graph the line $y = 3x + 4$.

First, we need to identify the slope and y-intercept of the line. The slope is 3, and the y-intercept is 4.

Next, we plot the y-intercept on the y-axis. This point is (0, 4).

Finally, we use the slope to find a second point on the line. If we move one unit to the right, the line rises by 3 units. So, the second point is (1, 7).

We can now connect the two points with a straight line, and we have graphed the line.

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the line $y = -2x + 5$.
2. Graph the line $y = \frac{1}{2}x + 3$.
3. Graph the line $y = -3x - 4$.

### Solutions

1. The slope of this line is -2 and the y-intercept is 5. We plot the y-intercept on the y-axis at (0, 5). Then, we move one unit to the right and the line drops by two units. So, the second point is (1, 3). We connect the two points with a straight line and we have graphed the line.

2. The slope of this line is $\frac{1}{2}$ and the y-intercept is 3. We plot the y-intercept on the y-axis at (0, 3). Then, we move one unit to the right and the line rises by one-half unit. So, the second point is (1, 3.5). We connect the two points with a straight line and we have graphed the line.

3. The slope of this line is -3 and the y-intercept is -4. We plot the y-intercept on the y-axis at (0, -4). Then, we move one unit to the right and the line drops by three units. So, the second point is (1, -7). We connect the two points with a straight line and we have graphed the line.

## C. Graphing Linear Equations

### Definition of a Graph

A graph is a visual representation of a mathematical equation. A graph is composed of two axes, the x-axis and the y-axis, and the coordinates of the points that make up the graph. The x-axis is the horizontal axis and the y-axis is the vertical axis. The coordinates of a point on a graph can be written in the form (x,y).

### Graphing a Linear Equation

A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants. To graph a linear equation, we first plot the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, and is written as (0,b). We then use the slope of the line, m, to find other points on the line. To do this, we choose a value for x, calculate the corresponding value for y, and plot the point. We then repeat this process for other values of x in order to plot more points on the line. Once we have plotted enough points, we can draw a line connecting them to create the graph of the linear equation.

### Example

Let's look at the equation y = 2x + 3. To graph this equation, we first plot the y-intercept, which is the point (0,3). We then use the slope, 2, to find other points on the line. For example, if x = 1, then y = 5, so we plot the point (1,5). If x = 2, then y = 7, so we plot the point (2,7). We can repeat this process for other values of x to plot more points on the line. Once we have plotted enough points, we can draw a line connecting them to create the graph of the equation.

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the equation y = 4x - 2
2. Graph the equation y = -3x + 5
3. Graph the equation y = -1/2x + 4

## D. Standard Form of a Linear Equation


### Introduction

A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form of `ax + b = 0`, where `a` and `b` are constants. The standard form of a linear equation is `Ax + By = C`, where `A`, `B`, and `C` are constants. This form is useful for solving linear equations and graphing linear equations.

### Example

For example, the equation `3x + 4y = 8` can be written in standard form as `3x + 4y = 8`.

### Graphing

The standard form of a linear equation can be used to graph the equation. To graph the equation `Ax + By = C`, first plot the `x` and `y` intercepts. The `x` intercept is the point where the line crosses the `x` axis and is found by setting `y = 0` and solving for `x`. The `y` intercept is the point where the line crosses the `y` axis and is found by setting `x = 0` and solving for `y`.

Once the intercepts are found, plot them on a graph and draw a line that connects them. This line is the graph of the equation `Ax + By = C`.

### Solving

The standard form of a linear equation can also be used to solve the equation. To solve the equation `Ax + By = C`, first rearrange the equation to get `y` on one side and everything else on the other side. Then divide both sides by `B` to solve for `y`. Finally, substitute the value of `y` into the original equation and solve for `x`.

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the equation `3x + 4y = 12`.
2. Solve the equation `2x + 3y = 9`.

### Solutions

1. The `x` intercept is found by setting `y = 0` and solving for `x`: `3x + 4(0) = 12` → `3x = 12` → `x = 4`. The `y` intercept is found by setting `x = 0` and solving for `y`: `3(0) + 4y = 12` → `4y = 12` → `y = 3`. Plot the intercepts on a graph and draw a line that connects them. This line is the graph of the equation `3x + 4y = 12`.

2. Rearrange the equation to get `y` on one side and everything else on the other side: `2x + 3y = 9` → `3y = 9 - 2x` → `y = (9 - 2x)/3`. Divide both sides by `3` to solve for `y`: `y = (9 - 2x)/3` → `y = 3 - (2/3)x`. Substitute the value of `y` into the original equation and solve for `x`: `2x + 3(3 - (2/3)x) = 9` → `2x + 9 - 2x = 9` → `x = 3`. The solution is `x = 3` and `y = 3 - (2/3)x = 3 - (2/3)(3) = 3 - 2 = 1`.

## E. Writing Linear Equations from Graphs


### Introduction

Writing linear equations from graphs is a skill that is essential to understanding algebra. It allows us to interpret a graph visually and then translate it into an algebraic equation. This can be very useful for solving problems that involve linear equations.

### Slope-Intercept Form

The most common way to write a linear equation from a graph is using the **slope-intercept form**. This form of the equation is written as:

```
y = mx + b
```

Where `m` is the slope of the line and `b` is the y-intercept. To find the slope, we can look at two points on the graph and use the formula:

```
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
```

To find the y-intercept, we can look at the graph and determine the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

### Example

Let's consider the following graph:

<img src="example-graph.png" width="400">

To write the equation for this graph, we first need to find the slope and y-intercept. We can pick any two points on the graph to calculate the slope. Let's choose the points (2, 4) and (4, 8). Using the formula above, we can calculate the slope as:

```
m = (8 - 4) / (4 - 2) = 4 / 2 = 2
```

Now we can look at the graph to find the y-intercept. We can see that the line crosses the y-axis at (0, -2). This means that the y-intercept is -2.

Using the slope and y-intercept, we can now write the equation for this graph in slope-intercept form:

```
y = 2x - 2
```

### Practice

Now that you understand how to write linear equations from graphs, try writing the equation for the following graphs.

1. <img src="practice-graph-1.png" width="400">

Answer:

```
y = -3x + 4
```

2. <img src="practice-graph-2.png" width="400">

Answer:

```
y = 3x - 6
```

## F. Solving Linear Equations


### Introduction

In this section, we will discuss how to solve linear equations. A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form of `ax + b = 0`, where `a` and `b` are constants. The solution of a linear equation is the value of the variable that makes the equation true.

### Solving Linear Equations

To solve a linear equation, we must first isolate the variable on one side of the equation. This can be done by adding or subtracting the same number from both sides of the equation, or by multiplying or dividing both sides of the equation by the same number.

Once the variable is isolated, we can solve for the value of the variable by performing the inverse operation on both sides of the equation.

#### Example

For example, consider the equation `2x + 4 = 10`. To solve for `x`, we must first isolate `x` on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract `4` from both sides of the equation, resulting in `2x = 6`.

Now that `x` is isolated, we can solve for `x` by performing the inverse operation of multiplication on both sides of the equation. This will result in `x = 3`. Therefore, the solution of the equation `2x + 4 = 10` is `x = 3`.

#### Practice Problems

1. Solve for `x` in the equation `3x + 7 = 17`.
    - Solution: `x = 5`
2. Solve for `y` in the equation `2y - 4 = 8`.
    - Solution: `y = 6`
3. Solve for `z` in the equation `5z + 10 = 25`.
    - Solution: `z = 3`

## G. Solving Systems of Linear Equations


### What is a System of Linear Equations?

A system of linear equations is a set of two or more linear equations that have the same set of unknowns. Solving a system of linear equations involves finding the values of all the unknowns that satisfy all of the equations in the system.

### Methods for Solving Systems of Linear Equations

There are several methods for solving systems of linear equations. The most common methods are:

- **Elimination Method**: This method involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one of the unknowns.
- **Substitution Method**: This method involves substituting one of the unknowns in one of the equations with its expression in terms of the other unknowns and then solving for the remaining unknowns.
- **Graphing Method**: This method involves graphing the equations in the system and finding the points of intersection.

### Example

Consider the following system of linear equations:

```
2x + y = 5
3x + 2y = 11
```

We can solve this system of equations using the elimination method. First, we add the two equations together to eliminate the variable y:

```
2x + y = 5
3x + 2y = 11

5x + 3y = 16
```

Next, we solve for x:

```
5x + 3y = 16

5x = 16 - 3y

x = (16 - 3y)/5
```

Finally, we substitute the expression for x into either of the original equations to solve for y:

```
2x + y = 5

2((16 - 3y)/5) + y = 5

2(16 - 3y) + 5y = 25

-8y = 9

y = -9/8
```

Therefore, the solution of the system of equations is x = (16 - 3y)/5 = (16 - 3(-9/8))/5 = 4 and y = -9/8.

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the following system of equations using the elimination method:

```
x + y = 5
2x + 4y = 8
```

Answer: x = 1 and y = 4

2. Solve the following system of equations using the substitution method:

```
2x - 5y = 7
3x + 2y = 9
```

Answer: x = 4 and y = -1

## H. Applications of Linear Equations

### Introduction
Linear equations are used in many different fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and more. In this section, we will explore some of the most common applications of linear equations.

### Balancing Chemical Equations
In chemistry, linear equations are used to balance chemical equations. A chemical equation is a representation of a chemical reaction, which is written in terms of the substances that are involved. In order for a chemical equation to be balanced, the number of atoms of each element on either side of the equation must be equal. This can be represented using linear equations.

For example, consider the following unbalanced chemical equation:

```
2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
```

To balance this equation, we can set up a system of linear equations:

```
2x + y = 2
2y = 1
```

Solving this system of equations, we find that x = 1 and y = 0.5, which gives us the balanced equation:

```
2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
```

### Economics
Linear equations are also used in economics to model the relationship between supply and demand. Supply and demand are two of the most fundamental concepts in economics, and they can be modelled using linear equations.

For example, consider a market where the supply and demand equations are given by:

```
Supply:  p = 10 + 2q
Demand:  p = 20 - 3q
```

Where p is the price of the good and q is the quantity of the good. To find the equilibrium price and quantity, we can set up a system of linear equations:

```
10 + 2q = 20 - 3q
2q + 3q = 20 - 10
5q = 10
q = 2
```

Then, substituting q = 2 into either of the equations, we find that p = 14. Therefore, the equilibrium price and quantity are p = 14 and q = 2.

### Engineering
Linear equations are also used in engineering to model physical systems. For example, consider a simple electrical circuit with a resistor and a capacitor. The voltage across the resistor and the capacitor can be modelled using a system of linear equations:

```

2. Consider a market where the supply and demand equations are given by:

```
Supply:  p = 8 + 2q
Demand:  p = 20 - 3q
```

Find the equilibrium price and quantity.

Answer:

The equilibrium price and quantity can be found by setting up a system of linear equations:

```
8 + 2q = 20 - 3q
2q + 3q = 20 - 8
5q = 12
q = 2.4
```

Substituting q = 2.4 into either of the equations, we find that p = 16.8. Therefore, the equilibrium price and quantity are p = 16.8 and q = 2.4.

# 5. Quadratic Equations


## A. Introduction to Quadratic Equations


### Overview
A **quadratic equation** is an equation of the form

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $a$ is not equal to zero. This equation can be used to model many real-world situations, such as the height of an object over time, the area of a rectangle, or the cost of a product.

The solutions to a quadratic equation can be found by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola, and the vertex of the parabola can be found using the equation. The axis of symmetry of the parabola can also be found using the equation, as well as the maximum or minimum value of the equation.

### Example

Let's look at an example of a quadratic equation and its solution:

$$2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0$$

The first step is to factor the equation. We can factor this equation by finding two numbers whose sum is 5 and whose product is -3. The two numbers are 3 and -1, so the equation can be factored as:

$$2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0$$
$$2x^2 + 3x - x - 3 = 0$$
$$(2x + 3)(x - 1) = 0$$

The solutions to the equation can be found by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for x.

$$2x + 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{3}{2}$$
$$x - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 1$$

Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation are $x = -\frac{3}{2}$ and $x = 1$.

### Practice

Try solving the following quadratic equations:

1. $$x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0$$
2. $$2x^2 + x - 3 = 0$$
3. $$4x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$$

**Solutions:**
1. $$x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0$$
$$(x - 6)(x + 1) = 0$$
$$x - 6 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 6$$
$$x + 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -1$$

Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation are $x = 6$ and $x = -1$.

2. $$2x^2 + x - 3 = 0$$
$$(2x + 3)(x - 1) = 0$$
$$2x + 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{3}{2}$$
$$x - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 1$$

Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation are $x = -\frac{3}{2}$ and $x = 1$.

3. $$4x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$$
$$(2x - 1)(2x - 2) = 0$$
$$2x - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{1}{2}$$
$$2x - 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 1$$

Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation are $x = \frac{1}{2}$ and $x = 1$.

## B. Standard Form of a Quadratic Equation


### What is Standard Form?

Standard form of a quadratic equation is an equation that is written in the form of ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are real numbers, and a ≠ 0.

### How to Write a Quadratic Equation in Standard Form

To write a quadratic equation in standard form, we first need to identify the coefficients of the equation. This can be done by looking at the equation and determining which terms have an x<sup>2</sup>, x, and constant coefficient.

For example, consider the equation: 4x<sup>2</sup> - 3x + 2 = 0. In this equation, the coefficient of x<sup>2</sup> is 4, the coefficient of x is -3, and the constant coefficient is 2. Therefore, the equation can be written in standard form as: 4x<sup>2</sup> - 3x + 2 = 0.

### Example

Let's take a look at a more complex example. Consider the equation: 2x<sup>2</sup> + 7x - 4x + 8 = 0. In this equation, the coefficient of x<sup>2</sup> is 2, the coefficient of x is 7 - 4 = 3, and the constant coefficient is 8. Therefore, the equation can be written in standard form as: 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 8 = 0.

### Practice Problems

1. Write the equation 3x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 1 = 0 in standard form.

Answer: 3x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 1 = 0 can be written in standard form as 3x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 1 = 0.

2. Write the equation 2x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 4 = 0 in standard form.

Answer: 2x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 4 = 0 can be written in standard form as 2x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 4 = 0.

## C. Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring

### What is Factoring?
Factoring is a method of solving quadratic equations by breaking down an equation into two or more simpler equations. This process can be used to solve equations of the form ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants.

### How to Factor
To factor a quadratic equation, you need to write the equation in the form ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0. Then, you need to find two numbers that multiply to give you c and add to give you b. These two numbers are called the factors of the equation.

For example, if we have the equation x<sup>2</sup> + 6x + 8 = 0, we can factor it by finding two numbers that multiply to give 8 and add to give 6. In this case, the two numbers are 4 and 2.

We can rewrite the equation as (x + 4)(x + 2) = 0. Then, we can solve for x by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for x.

In this example, we would get x + 4 = 0 and x + 2 = 0. Solving each equation gives us x = -4 and x = -2. So, the solutions to the equation are x = -4 and x = -2.

### Practice Problem

Factor the equation x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 6 = 0.

The answer is (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0. So, the solutions to the equation are x = 3 and x = 2.

## D. Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square


### Introduction

Completing the square is a technique used to solve quadratic equations. It involves rearranging the equation into a perfect square trinomial. This technique can be used to solve equations that cannot be solved using factoring or the quadratic formula.

### Steps

1. Move all terms to one side of the equation, leaving the constant on the other side.
2. Divide each term by the coefficient of the x2 term.
3. Add the square of half the coefficient of the x term to both sides of the equation.
4. Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms.
5. Take the square root of both sides of the equation.
6. Solve for x.

### Example

Solve the equation:  2x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 3 = 0

1. Move all terms to one side of the equation, leaving the constant on the other side.

2x<sup>2</sup> + 5x = -3

2. Divide each term by the coefficient of the x2 term.

(2x<sup>2</sup>/2) + (5x/2) = -3/2

3. Add the square of half the coefficient of the x term to both sides of the equation.

(2x<sup>2</sup>/2) + (5x/2) + (5/4)<sup>2</sup> = -3/2 + (5/4)<sup>2</sup>

4. Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms.

x<sup>2</sup> + 5x/2 + 5/4 = -3/2 + 25/16

5. Take the square root of both sides of the equation.

x + 5/4 = ±√(-3/2 + 25/16)

6. Solve for x.

x = -5/4 ±√(-3/2 + 25/16)

## E. Solving Quadratic Equations by Using the Quadratic Formula


### Overview

The quadratic formula is a method of solving a quadratic equation, which is an equation with a second-degree (or higher) polynomial. It is useful for finding the roots of a quadratic equation, which is the value of x for which the equation is equal to zero. The quadratic formula can be written as:

`x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}`

where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

### Explaining the Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is a way of solving a quadratic equation. It works by using the coefficients of the equation to calculate the roots of the equation. The formula is written as:

`x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}`

The part of the formula inside the square root is known as the discriminant, and it is used to determine the number and types of solutions to the equation. If the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions. If the discriminant is zero, there is one real solution. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions.

The plus-minus sign (±) indicates that there are two solutions: one with the plus sign, and one with the minus sign.

### Solving Quadratic Equations Using the Quadratic Formula

To solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, you must first identify the coefficients a, b, and c. Then, plug these values into the formula and solve for x.

For example, let's solve the equation `2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0` using the quadratic formula.

First, identify the coefficients:
- a = 2
- b = 5
- c = -3

Now, plug these values into the formula:

`x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(2)(-3)}}{2(2)}`

`x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 24}}{4}`

`x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4}`

`x = \frac{-5 \pm 7}{4}`

Finally, solve for x:

`x = \frac{-5 + 7}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5`

`x = \frac{-5 - 7}{4} = \frac{-12}{4} = -3`

Therefore, the solutions to the equation `2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0` are x = 0.5 and x = -3.

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the equation `x^2 + 4x - 21 = 0` using the quadratic formula.

Answer:

First, identify the coefficients:
- a = 1
- b = 4
- c = -21

Now, plug these values into the formula:

`x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(-21)}}{2(1)}`

`x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2}`

`x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2}`

Finally, solve for x:

`x = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3`

`x = \frac{-4 - \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7`

Therefore, the solutions to the equation `x^2 + 4x - 21 = 0` are x = 3 and x = -7.

2. Solve the equation `2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0` using the quadratic formula.

Answer:

First, identify the coefficients:
- a = 2
- b = -6
- c = 4

Now, plug these values into the formula:

`x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4(2)(4)}}{2(2)}`

`x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt

## F. Graphing Quadratic Equations


### What is a Quadratic Equation?

A quadratic equation is an equation of the form

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

where $a, b,$ and $c$ are constants. Quadratic equations have two solutions, which can be found using a variety of methods.

### Graphing Quadratic Equations

The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola. The shape of the parabola depends on the sign of the coefficient of $x^2$ (the $a$ in the equation).

If $a > 0$, the parabola opens upward and is concave up.

If $a < 0$, the parabola opens downward and is concave down.

The axis of symmetry of the parabola is the line that divides the parabola into two equal halves. It is given by the equation

$$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$$

The vertex of the parabola is the point at which the parabola changes direction. It is given by the coordinates

$$(x, y) = \left(-\frac{b}{2a}, -\frac{D}{4a}\right)$$

where $D$ is the discriminant of the quadratic equation, given by

$$D = b^2 - 4ac$$

### Example

The equation $x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0$ has two solutions, $x = -3$ and $x = -3$. The coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, so the parabola opens upward and is concave up. The axis of symmetry is $x = -3$ and the vertex is $(-3, 0)$.

The graph of this equation is shown below:

![Graph of x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0](graph.png)

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the equation $2x^2 - 8x - 10 = 0$.
2. Find the axis of symmetry and vertex of the equation $3x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$.
3. Graph the equation $-5x^2 + 10x + 6 = 0$.

### Solutions

1. The coefficient of $x^2$ is negative, so the parabola opens downward and is concave down. The axis of symmetry is $x = 4$ and the vertex is $(4, -4)$.

![Graph of 2x^2 - 8x - 10 = 0](graph2.png)

2. The axis of symmetry is $x = 1$ and the vertex is $(1, -2)$.

3. The coefficient of $x^2$ is negative, so the parabola opens downward and is concave down. The axis of symmetry is $x = 2$ and the vertex is $(2, 3)$.

![Graph of -5x^2 + 10x + 6 = 0](graph3.png)

## G. Vertex of a Quadratic Equation


### What is a Vertex?

The vertex of a quadratic equation is the point where the graph of the equation crosses the x-axis. It is the highest or lowest point of the graph, depending on the sign of the coefficient of the quadratic term. The vertex is also known as the turning point, as it marks the point at which the graph changes direction from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.

The vertex of a quadratic equation can be found by solving the equation for the x-coordinate of the vertex. This is done by using the formula:

$$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$$

Where `a` is the coefficient of the quadratic term, `b` is the coefficient of the linear term, and `c` is the constant term.

### Example

Consider the quadratic equation:

$$f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 3$$

The coefficient of the quadratic term is `a = 1`, the coefficient of the linear term is `b = 4`, and the constant term is `c = 3`.

Using the formula above, we can calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex:

$$x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{4}{2} = -2$$

Therefore, the vertex of this equation is at the point `(-2, 3)`.

### Practice Problems

1. Find the vertex of the equation: $f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8$

2. Find the vertex of the equation: $f(x) = -2x^2 + 8x + 1$

3. Find the vertex of the equation: $f(x) = 3x^2 + 6x - 7$

### Solutions

1. The coefficient of the quadratic term is `a = 1`, the coefficient of the linear term is `b = -6`, and the constant term is `c = 8`. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:

$$x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-6}{2} = 3$$

Therefore, the vertex of this equation is at the point `(3, 8)`.

2. The coefficient of the quadratic term is `a = -2`, the coefficient of the linear term is `b = 8`, and the constant term is `c = 1`. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:

$$x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{8}{-4} = 2$$

Therefore, the vertex of this equation is at the point `(2, 1)`.

3. The coefficient of the quadratic term is `a = 3`, the coefficient of the linear term is `b = 6`, and the constant term is `c = -7`. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:

$$x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{6}{6} = -1$$

Therefore, the vertex of this equation is at the point `(-1, -7)`.

## H. Finding the Axis of Symmetry


### What is the Axis of Symmetry?
The axis of symmetry is a line that divides a parabola into two mirror-image halves. It is also known as the line of symmetry or the x-axis of symmetry. The axis of symmetry passes through the vertex of the parabola, and is perpendicular to the directrix.

### Finding the Axis of Symmetry
In order to find the axis of symmetry of a quadratic equation, we need to first identify the vertex of the parabola. The vertex is the highest or lowest point of the parabola, and is located at the point where the parabola changes direction.

Once we have identified the vertex, we can use the following formula to calculate the axis of symmetry:

Axis of Symmetry = x-coordinate of the vertex

For example, if the vertex of the parabola is at (4, -2), then the axis of symmetry would be x = 4.

### Example

Let's take a look at an example. Consider the following quadratic equation:

`y = -2x^2 + 8x - 3`

To find the axis of symmetry, we first need to find the vertex. To do this, we can use the formula:

Vertex = (x-coordinate, y-coordinate)

We can calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex using the following formula:

x-coordinate = -b / 2a

In this example, a = -2, b = 8, and c = -3. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:

x-coordinate = -b / 2a = -8 / 2(-2) = 4

Now, we can use this value to calculate the axis of symmetry:

Axis of Symmetry = x-coordinate of the vertex = 4

Therefore, the axis of symmetry of the parabola is x = 4.

### Practice Problems

1. Find the axis of symmetry for the following equation:

`y = 6x^2 - 10x - 11`

Answer: x = 5

2. Find the axis of symmetry for the following equation:

`y = -3x^2 + 9x - 4`

Answer: x = 3

## I. Finding the Maximum or Minimum Value of a Quadratic Equation


### Introduction

The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic equation is the highest or lowest value that the equation reaches. The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic equation can be found by using the vertex of the graph of the equation. The vertex is the point where the graph of the equation reaches its highest or lowest point.

### Finding the Vertex

To find the vertex of a quadratic equation, we must first rewrite the equation in standard form, which is:

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

The vertex of a quadratic equation is found by using the following formula:

$$Vertex: (-\frac{b}{2a}, \frac{-b^2 - 4ac}{4a})$$

For example, let's consider the equation:

$$3x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$$

To find the vertex, we will use the formula:

$$Vertex: (-\frac{-6}{2(3)}, \frac{(-6)^2 - 4(3)(4)}{4(3)})$$

$$Vertex: (1, -2)$$

### Finding the Maximum or Minimum Value

Once we have found the vertex of the equation, we can use it to find the maximum or minimum value. The maximum or minimum value is the y-coordinate of the vertex. In the example above, the vertex is (1, -2), so the maximum or minimum value of the equation is -2.

### Practice Problems

1. Find the vertex and maximum or minimum value of the equation:

$$2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0$$

Vertex: (-2, 4)
Maximum or Minimum Value: 4

2. Find the vertex and maximum or minimum value of the equation:

$$x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0$$

Vertex: (3, 0)
Maximum or Minimum Value: 0

## J. Using Quadratic Equations to Model Real-World Situations


### Introduction

Quadratic equations can be used to model a wide variety of real-world situations, from the motion of a projectile to the growth of a population. In this section, we will explore some of the ways that quadratic equations can be used to model real-world situations.

### Parabolas

One of the most common uses of quadratic equations is to model the motion of a projectile. This is often done by using a parabola, which is a graph of a quadratic equation. When a projectile is launched, its trajectory can be represented by a parabola, which can be modeled by a quadratic equation.

For example, consider a projectile launched with an initial velocity of 50 m/s at an angle of 30 degrees. The equation for the trajectory of the projectile can be modeled using the following quadratic equation:

`y = -0.5x^2 + 50x * sin(30) + 0`

This equation can be used to determine the position of the projectile at any given time.

### Maximum Height

Another common use of quadratic equations is to determine the maximum height of a projectile. This can be done by finding the vertex of the parabola, which can be found by solving the quadratic equation.

For example, consider the same projectile launched with an initial velocity of 50 m/s at an angle of 30 degrees. The equation for the trajectory of the projectile is:

`y = -0.5x^2 + 50x * sin(30) + 0`

The vertex of the parabola can be found by solving the quadratic equation:

`0 = -0.5x^2 + 50x * sin(30) + 0`

Solving this equation yields the following values for x:

`x = 0` and `x = 50/sin(30)`

The maximum height of the projectile can then be determined by substituting the value of x into the equation:

`y = -0.5 (50/sin(30))^2 + 50 (50/sin(30)) * sin(30) + 0`

This yields a maximum height of `125 m`.

### Growth of a Population

Quadratic equations can also be used to model the growth of a population. This can be done by using a quadratic equation to model the population at any given time.

For example, consider a population that starts with 10 individuals and grows at a rate of 5% per year. The equation for the population at any given time can be modeled using the following quadratic equation:

`P = 10(1.05)^t`

where P is the population and t is the time in years.

This equation can be used to determine the population at any given time. For example, the population after 5 years can be determined by substituting 5 for t in the equation:

`P = 10(1.05)^5`

This yields a population of `16.28`.

### Practice Problems

1. A projectile is launched with an initial velocity of 20 m/s at an angle of 45 degrees. Write the equation for the trajectory of the projectile.

Answer: `y = -0.5x^2 + 20x * sin(45) + 0`

2. A population starts with 10 individuals and grows at a rate of 10% per year. Determine the population after 8 years.

Answer: `P = 10(1.10)^8`

This yields a population of `25.97`.

# 6. Polynomials


## A. Definition of a Polynomial

### What is a Polynomial?
A polynomial is an expression that consists of variables (x, y, z, etc.), constants (numbers), and exponents (powers of the variables). Polynomials can be written in standard form (ordered from highest to lowest exponent) or in factored form (factored into the product of two or more polynomials).

### Examples
Some examples of polynomials include:

- 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 5
- (x + 2)(x + 3)
- 3x<sup>4</sup> - 5x<sup>2</sup> + 2

### Degrees of Polynomials
The degree of a polynomial is the highest exponent of the variables in the expression. The degree of the polynomial 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 5 is 2, since the highest exponent of x is 2. The degree of the polynomial (x + 2)(x + 3) is 1, since the highest exponent of x is 1. The degree of the polynomial 3x<sup>4</sup> - 5x<sup>2</sup> + 2 is 4, since the highest exponent of x is 4.

### Operations with Polynomials
Polynomials can be manipulated using basic algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### Adding and Subtracting Polynomials
When adding or subtracting polynomials, the same operation can be done to each term. For example, to add the polynomials 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 5 and 3x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 4, we can add the coefficients of each term:

2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 5 + 3x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 4 = 5x<sup>2</sup> + x + 9

#### Multiplying Polynomials
When multiplying polynomials, the distributive property can be used. For example, to multiply the polynomials (x + 2)(x + 3), we can multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

(x + 2)(x + 3) = x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 3x + 6 = x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 6

#### Dividing Polynomials
When dividing polynomials, the quotient and remainder can be found using long division. For example, to divide the polynomial 4x<sup>3</sup> + 11x<sup>2</sup> - 3x - 9 by the polynomial x + 3, we can use long division:

4x<sup>3</sup> + 11x<sup>2</sup> - 3x - 9 ÷ x + 3 = 4x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 3 + (3)

The quotient is 4x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 3 and the remainder is 3.

### Practice Problems
1. Find the degree of the polynomial 4x<sup>3</sup> - 2x<sup>2</sup> + 7

Answer: The degree of the polynomial 4x<sup>3</sup> - 2x<sup>2</sup> + 7 is 3, since the highest exponent of x is 3.

2. Add the polynomials 4x<sup>2</sup> + 5x - 3 and 2x<sup>2</sup> - 7x + 4

Answer: 4x<sup>2</sup> + 5x - 3 + 2x<sup>2</sup> - 7x + 4 = 6x<sup>2</sup> - 2x - 7

## B. Degree of a Polynomial


### What is the Degree of a Polynomial?

A polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of variables (x, y, etc.) and coefficients (numbers). The degree of a polynomial is the highest exponent of the variable in the expression. The degree of a polynomial is an important concept in algebra, as it helps to determine the nature of the graph of the polynomial.

For example, the polynomial `2x^2 + 5x + 4` has a degree of 2, as the highest exponent of the variable x is 2.

The degree of a polynomial can be determined by looking at the highest exponent of the variable. If the polynomial has more than one variable, the degree is determined by the highest exponent of any of the variables. For example, the polynomial `2x^2 + 5y^3 + 4` has a degree of 3, as the highest exponent of any of the variables is 3.

### Types of Polynomials

Polynomials can be divided into three main categories, based on their degree:

1. **Linear Polynomials**: These are polynomials with a degree of 1. Examples include `2x + 5`, `3x - 7`, and `-4x + 9`.

2. **Quadratic Polynomials**: These are polynomials with a degree of 2. Examples include `2x^2 + 5x + 4`, `3x^2 - 7x + 8`, and `-4x^2 + 9x + 6`.

3. **Cubic Polynomials**: These are polynomials with a degree of 3. Examples include `2x^3 + 5x^2 + 4x + 7`, `3x^3 - 7x^2 + 8x - 9`, and `-4x^3 + 9x^2 + 6x - 5`.

### Example

Let's look at the polynomial `2x^2 + 5x + 4`.

The highest exponent of the variable x is 2, so the degree of this polynomial is 2. This means that the polynomial is a quadratic polynomial.

### Practice Problems

1. Determine the degree of the polynomial `3x^2 - 4x + 7`.
2. Determine the degree of the polynomial `2x^3 + 5y^2 - 6xy + 7`.
3. Determine the degree of the polynomial `-x^2 + y^3 - 5xy + 2`.

### Answers

1. The degree of the polynomial `3x^2 - 4x + 7` is 2.
2. The degree of the polynomial `2x^3 + 5y^2 - 6xy + 7` is 3.
3. The degree of the polynomial `-x^2 + y^3 - 5xy + 2` is 3.

## C. Adding and Subtracting Polynomials

### Definition

A **polynomial** is an expression composed of constants, variables, and exponents. It can be written as a sum of monomials, where each monomial is a product of constants and variables with a single exponent.

### Adding Polynomials

Adding polynomials is a straightforward process. To add two polynomials, simply add the coefficients of like terms. For example, to add two polynomials:

$2x^2 + 3x + 4$

$7x^2 + 5x - 2$

The result is:

$9x^2 + 8x + 2$

It is important to note that the order of the terms is irrelevant when adding polynomials.

### Subtracting Polynomials

Subtracting polynomials is similar to adding polynomials, but instead of adding the coefficients of like terms, subtract them. For example, to subtract two polynomials:

$2x^2 + 3x + 4$

$7x^2 + 5x - 2$

The result is:

$-5x^2 - 2x + 6$

### Practice Problems

1. Add the following polynomials:

$3x^2 + 2x - 4$

$7x^2 - 4x + 2$

Answer: $10x^2 - 2x - 2$

2. Subtract the following polynomials:

$7x^2 + 5x - 2$

$2x^2 + 3x + 4$

Answer: $-5x^2 + 2x - 6$

## D. Multiplying Polynomials


### Overview

Multiplying polynomials is a process of combining two or more polynomials to create a new polynomial. It is an important concept in algebra and can be used to solve many equations. The process of multiplying polynomials can be broken down into several steps:

1. Identify the terms to be multiplied
2. Multiply each term of one polynomial by each term of the other
3. Add the resulting terms

### Terms to be Multiplied

The first step in multiplying polynomials is to identify the terms to be multiplied. Polynomials are composed of terms, which are made up of coefficients, variables, and exponents. For example, in the polynomial `3x^2 + 4x - 5`, the terms are `3x^2`, `4x`, and `-5`.

### Multiplying Terms

The second step in multiplying polynomials is to multiply each term of one polynomial by each term of the other. For example, if we have the polynomials `2x^2 + 5x` and `3x + 4`, we would multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial. This would give us the following:

- `2x^2 * 3x = 6x^3`
- `2x^2 * 4 = 8x^2`
- `5x * 3x = 15x^2`
- `5x * 4 = 20x`

### Adding the Resulting Terms

The final step in multiplying polynomials is to add the resulting terms. In our example, the resulting terms are `6x^3`, `8x^2`, `15x^2`, and `20x`. We can add these terms together to get the final result: `6x^3 + 8x^2 + 15x^2 + 20x = 29x^3 + 23x^2`.

### Practice Problems

1. Multiply `3x^2 + 7x - 2` and `4x - 5`.

Answer: `12x^3 + 13x^2 - 29x + 10`

2. Multiply `2x^3 - x + 5` and `x^2 - 3x + 2`.

Answer: `2x^5 - 5x^4 + 7x^3 + 9x^2 - 11x + 10`

## E. Dividing Polynomials


### Introduction
Dividing polynomials is a process of breaking up a polynomial into a fraction of two polynomials. This process is very similar to the process of long division which is used to divide two numbers.

### Dividing Polynomials

To divide two polynomials, we use the same process as long division. We will divide the dividend (the polynomial being divided) by the divisor (the polynomial that is dividing).

#### Step 1: Rewrite the Dividend and Divisor
The first step is to rewrite the dividend and divisor into a fraction. To do this, we will divide the dividend by the divisor and set it equal to a fraction.

#### Step 2: Find the Leading Coefficient
The next step is to find the leading coefficient of the divisor. The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the highest degree term in the divisor.

#### Step 3: Divide the Leading Coefficient
Once we have the leading coefficient, we can divide it by the dividend's leading coefficient. This will give us the first term of the quotient.

#### Step 4: Multiply the Quotient
We then multiply the quotient by the divisor and subtract it from the dividend. This will give us the remainder.

#### Step 5: Repeat
We then repeat steps 3 and 4 until the remainder is 0.

### Examples

#### Example 1
Let's divide the polynomial `3x^3 + 5x^2 - 6x + 2` by the polynomial `x - 2`.

##### Step 1: Rewrite the Dividend and Divisor
We will rewrite the dividend and divisor into a fraction.

`(3x^3 + 5x^2 - 6x + 2) / (x - 2)`

##### Step 2: Find the Leading Coefficient
The leading coefficient of the divisor is 1.

##### Step 3: Divide the Leading Coefficient
We will divide 1 by 3 to get the first term of the quotient.

`1/3 * (3x^3 + 5x^2 - 6x + 2)`

##### Step 4: Multiply the Quotient
We will multiply the quotient by the divisor and subtract it from the dividend.

`(3x^3 + 5x^2 - 6x + 2) - (1/3 * (x - 2))`

This gives us the remainder `2x^2 + 11/3x + 2`.

##### Step 5: Repeat
We will repeat steps 3 and 4 until the remainder is 0.

`(2x^2 + 11/3x + 2) - (2/3 * (x - 2)) = 4/3x + 8/3`

`(4/3x + 8/3) - (4/3 * (x - 2)) = 16/9`

The remainder is 0, so the final answer is:

`(3x^3 + 5x^2 - 6x + 2) / (x - 2) = x^2 + 11/3x - 2/3 + 16/9`

## F. Factoring Polynomials


### Definition
Factoring polynomials is a process of expressing a polynomial as a product of two or more polynomials with simpler expressions. It is used to simplify complex polynomials into simpler forms.

### Examples
Let's look at a few examples of factoring polynomials.

**Example 1**

Factor the polynomial $4x^2 - 16$.

Solution:

This polynomial can be factored as $(2x + 4)(2x - 4)$.

**Example 2**

Factor the polynomial $x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x$.

Solution:

This polynomial can be factored as $(x + 4)(x^2 - 1)$.

### Common Factoring Techniques
The following are some of the most common techniques used to factor polynomials.

**1. Factor by Grouping**

This technique is used when a polynomial has four terms. It involves grouping the terms into pairs, and then factoring the common factor from each pair.

**Example**

Factor the polynomial $3x^3 + 6x^2 - 5x - 10$.

Solution:

We can group the terms into two pairs: $(3x^3 + 6x^2)$ and $(-5x - 10)$. Now, we can factor out the common factor $3x$ from each pair to get $(3x)(x^2 + 2)$ and $(-3x)(-5 - \frac{10}{3})$. Finally, we can factor out the common factor $(x + 2)$ from the first pair and $(-5 - \frac{10}{3})$ from the second pair to get $(3x)(x + 2)(-5 - \frac{10}{3})$.

**2. Factoring by Taking the Greatest Common Factor**

This technique is used to factor polynomials with more than four terms. It involves taking the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms and factoring it out.

**Example**

Factor the polynomial $2x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x - 12$.

Solution:

The GCF of all the terms is $2x$. So, we can factor out the GCF to get $(2x)(x^2 + 3x - 6)$.

**3. Factoring Quadratic Expressions**

This technique is used to factor quadratic expressions, i.e. polynomials with degree 2. It involves using the special form of the quadratic equation, which is $ax^2 + bx + c = a(x - r)(x - s)$.

**Example**

Factor the polynomial $2x^2 + 7x + 3$.

Solution:

Using the special form of the quadratic equation, we can factor this polynomial as $2x^2 + 7x + 3 = 2(x + 3)(x + 1)$.

## G. Solving Polynomial Equations


### Introduction

Solving polynomial equations is a key skill in algebra. A polynomial equation is an equation that contains only polynomials, which are mathematical expressions that involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of variables and constants.

In this section, we will discuss the process of solving polynomial equations. We will also discuss how to graph polynomial functions and how to use the graph to find solutions.

### Solving Polynomial Equations

The first step in solving a polynomial equation is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. This can be done by using the same operations that were used to create the equation. For example, if the equation is `2x + 7 = 11`, we can subtract 7 from both sides to get `2x = 4`, which we can then divide by 2 to get `x = 2`.

Once the variable is isolated, we can use the methods of factoring and completing the square to solve more complex equations.

#### Factoring

Factoring is the process of breaking down an expression into its individual factors. For example, the expression `2x^2 + 5x + 3` can be factored into `(2x + 3)(x + 1)`.

Factoring can be used to solve equations of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. To solve such an equation, we can factor the left side of the equation into two linear factors, and then set each factor equal to zero. For example, the equation `2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0` can be factored into `(2x + 3)(x + 1) = 0`. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us two equations: `2x + 3 = 0` and `x + 1 = 0`. Solving these equations gives us the solutions `x = -3/2` and `x = -1`.

#### Completing the Square

Completing the square is another method for solving polynomial equations. This method is used for equations of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. To solve such an equation using completing the square, we first rewrite the equation in the form `ax^2 + bx = -c`. Then, we add a constant to both sides of the equation to make the left side a perfect square. For example, if we have the equation `2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0`, we can rewrite it as `2x^2 + 5x = -3` and then add 4 to both sides to get `2x^2 + 5x + 4 = 1`.

The left side of the equation is now a perfect square, so we can factor it into `(2x + 2)^2 = 1`. Taking the square root of both sides gives us `2x + 2 = ±1`, which we can solve to get `x = -3/2` and `x = -1`.

### Graphing Polynomial Functions

Once we have solved a polynomial equation, we can use the graph of the polynomial function to find additional solutions. To graph a polynomial function, we first need to find the zeroes, or the x-intercepts of the graph. These are the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. To find the zeroes, we can either use the solutions we found when solving the equation, or we can use the factored form of the equation.

Once we have the zeroes, we can use them to draw the graph of the polynomial function. We can then use the graph to find additional solutions. For example, if the graph crosses the x-axis at the points (-3/2, 0) and (-1, 0), we can see that the graph has a minimum at (-3/2, -1/4). This means that the equation `2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0` has an additional solution of `x = -3/2`.

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the equation `2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0`.

Answer: The solutions to this equation are `x = -3/2` and `x = -1`.

2. Graph the polynomial function `f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 3`.

Answer: The graph of this function looks like this:

![Graph of f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 3](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/images/quadratic-graph.sv

## H. Graphing Polynomial Functions

### What is a Graph?
A graph is a visual representation of a mathematical function. It is a way of visually displaying the relationship between two variables. The x-axis of a graph is the independent variable, while the y-axis is the dependent variable.

### How to Graph a Polynomial Function
Graphing a polynomial function is relatively straightforward. The basic steps are as follows:

1. Determine the degree of the polynomial.
2. Determine the x-intercepts of the polynomial.
3. Determine the y-intercept of the polynomial.
4. Plot the points determined in steps 1-3.
5. Connect the points with a smooth curve.

### Example
Let's graph the polynomial function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2.

1. The degree of the polynomial is 2.
2. To find the x-intercepts, we need to solve the equation f(x) = 0. In this case, we get x = -1 and x = -2.
3. To find the y-intercept, we plug in x = 0 into the equation. We get f(0) = 2, so the y-intercept is (0, 2).
4. We can now plot the points (0, 2), (-1, 0), and (-2, 0).
5. We connect the points with a smooth curve and we have our graph:

![Graph of f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Quadratic_function_graph.svg/800px-Quadratic_function_graph.svg.png)

### Practice Problems
1. Graph the polynomial function f(x) = 3x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x - 6.
2. Graph the polynomial function f(x) = x^4 - 5x^3 + 6x^2 + 7x - 8.
3. Graph the polynomial function f(x) = 2x^5 - 3x^4 + 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 7.

# 7. Factoring


## A. Definition of Factoring


### What is Factoring?
Factoring is the process of breaking down an expression or equation into its component parts. It is a key concept in Algebra and is used to simplify equations and solve for unknowns. It is also used to identify common factors between two or more expressions.

### Examples of Factoring
Let's look at an example of factoring. Consider the equation:

```
2x^2 + 3x – 4 = 0
```

We can use factoring to solve this equation. First, we identify a common factor between the terms, in this case it is 2x. We can then factor out the common factor and rewrite the equation as:

```
2x(x + 3) – 4 = 0
```

Now, we can identify two factors of -4, which are -2 and 2. We can then rewrite the equation as:

```
2x(x + 3) – 2(2) = 0
```

Finally, we can factor out the common factor of 2, which gives us:

```
2(x + 3 – 1) = 0
```

Now, we can solve for x by setting each factor equal to 0 and solving for x. In this case, x = -3 and x = 1.

### Practice Problem
Let's try another example. Consider the equation:

```
6x^2 + 11x – 5 = 0
```

Using the same process as before, we can factor out the common factor of 6x to get:

```
6x(x + 11) – 5 = 0
```

Now, we can identify two factors of -5, which are -1 and 5. We can then rewrite the equation as:

```
6x(x + 11) – 1(5) = 0
```

Finally, we can factor out the common factor of 1, which gives us:

```
(x + 11 – 5)(6x) = 0
```

Now, we can solve for x by setting each factor equal to 0 and solving for x. In this case, x = -11 and x = 5.

## B. Factoring Out Common Factors


### What is Factoring Out Common Factors?
Factoring out common factors is a process for simplifying algebraic expressions by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of a group of terms and then dividing each term in the group by the GCF. This can be used to simplify equations and expressions, and can also be used to solve equations.

For example, if you have the expression `2x^2 + 4x + 4`, the GCF of the terms is `2x`. To factor out the common factor, you would divide each term by `2x` to get `x^2 + 2x + 2`.

### Examples

Let's look at a few examples of factoring out common factors.

#### Example 1

Consider the expression `3x^2 + 6x + 9`. The GCF of the terms is `3x`, so we can factor out the common factor by dividing each term by `3x` to get `x^2 + 2x + 3`.

#### Example 2

Consider the expression `2x^2 + 5x + 3`. The GCF of the terms is `x`, so we can factor out the common factor by dividing each term by `x` to get `2x + 5 + 3`.

#### Example 3

Consider the expression `4x^2 + 12x + 9`. The GCF of the terms is `4x`, so we can factor out the common factor by dividing each term by `4x` to get `x^2 + 3x + 9/4`.

### Practice Problems

Now let's try some practice problems.

1. Factor out the common factor of `3x^2 + 6x + 9`.

Answer: The GCF of the terms is `3x`, so we can factor out the common factor by dividing each term by `3x` to get `x^2 + 2x + 3`.

2. Factor out the common factor of `2x^2 + 5x + 3`.

Answer: The GCF of the terms is `x`, so we can factor out the common factor by dividing each term by `x` to get `2x + 5 + 3`.

3. Factor out the common factor of `4x^2 + 12x + 9`.

Answer: The GCF of the terms is `4x`, so we can factor out the common factor by dividing each term by `4x` to get `x^2 + 3x + 9/4`.

## C. Factoring Trinomials


### Definition of Factoring Trinomials

Factoring trinomials is the process of breaking down a trinomial into its component parts, which are typically two binomials. A trinomial is an algebraic expression with three terms, such as 5x<sup>2</sup> + 10x + 5. The process of factoring trinomials is similar to factoring out common factors, but there are a few key differences.

### Factoring Trinomials by Grouping

The most common way to factor trinomials is by grouping. This method involves grouping the first two terms and the last two terms of the trinomial and then factoring out the common factor of the two groups. For example, let's look at the trinomial 5x<sup>2</sup> + 10x + 5. We can group the first two terms and the last two terms like this:

(5x<sup>2</sup> + 10x) + (5)

We can then factor out the common factor of 5 from the two groups.

5(x<sup>2</sup> + 2x) + 5

We can then factor out the common factor of x from the first group.

5x(x + 2) + 5

Finally, we can factor out the common factor of 5 from the last two terms.

5x(x + 2) + 5(1)

The final factorization of the trinomial is 5x(x + 2) + 5.

### Factoring Trinomials by Using the Difference of Two Squares

Another way to factor trinomials is by using the difference of two squares. This method involves factoring the trinomial into two binomials that are the difference of two perfect squares. For example, let's look at the trinomial x<sup>2</sup> + 6x + 9. We can factor this trinomial by using the difference of two squares like this:

x<sup>2</sup> + 6x + 9

= (x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 3x + 9)

= (x + 3)(x + 3)

The final factorization of the trinomial is (x + 3)(x + 3).

### Practice Problems

1. Factor the trinomial x<sup>2</sup> + 8x + 16.

Answer: (x + 4)(x + 4)

2. Factor the trinomial 5x<sup>2</sup> + 10x + 5.

Answer: 5x(x + 2) + 5

## D. Factoring Difference of Squares


### Definition
Factoring the difference of squares is a method of factoring that is used when the equation has a difference of two squares. A difference of two squares is a binomial expression that has the form `a² - b²`.

### Example
For example, let's take the equation `x² - 16`. Here, `a = x` and `b = 4`. To factor this equation, we must factor the two squares separately. The square of `x` can be factored to `x * x`, and the square of `4` can be factored to `4 * 4`.

### Solution
Now, we can rewrite the equation as `(x * x) - (4 * 4)`. We can then factor out the common factor of `4` from both terms, resulting in `4 * (x - 4) * (x + 4)`. Therefore, the factored form of `x² - 16` is `4 * (x - 4) * (x + 4)`.

### Practice Problem
Let's try another example. Factor the equation `y² - 25`.

### Solution
In this equation, `a = y` and `b = 5`. We can factor the two squares separately, resulting in `(y * y) - (5 * 5)`. We can then factor out the common factor of `5` from both terms, resulting in `5 * (y - 5) * (y + 5)`. Therefore, the factored form of `y² - 25` is `5 * (y - 5) * (y + 5)`.

## E. Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials


### Introduction

Factoring perfect square trinomials is a special type of factoring that involves breaking down a trinomial of the form `ax^2 + bx + c` into two binomials of the form `(mx + n)(px + q)`. In order to factor perfect square trinomials, you must understand the concept of a square root and be able to identify perfect squares.

### Identifying Perfect Squares

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 4 is a perfect square because it is the square of 2 (`2^2 = 4`). Other examples of perfect squares include 9 (`3^2 = 9`), 16 (`4^2 = 16`), and 25 (`5^2 = 25`).

### Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials

To factor a perfect square trinomial, you must identify the perfect square and then use the following steps:

1. Rewrite the trinomial in the form `ax^2 + bx + a^2`.
2. Factor out the common factor `a`.
3. Rewrite the trinomial as `a(x^2 + b/a x + a)`.
4. Factor the remaining part of the trinomial using the difference of two squares formula: `(x + b/2a)(x + b/2a)`.

Let's look at an example. Consider the trinomial `4x^2 + 16x + 16`.

1. Rewrite the trinomial as `4x^2 + 16x + 16`.
2. Factor out the common factor `4` to get `4(x^2 + 4x + 4)`.
3. Rewrite the trinomial as `4(x^2 + 4x + 4)`.
4. Factor the remaining part of the trinomial using the difference of two squares formula: `(x + 2)(x + 2)`.

The final answer is `4(x + 2)(x + 2)`.

### Practice Problems

1. Factor `9x^2 + 18x + 9`.
2. Factor `25x^2 + 50x + 25`.
3. Factor `16x^2 + 32x + 16`.

### Answers

1. `9(x + 1)(x + 1)`
2. `25(x + 2)(x + 2)`
3. `16(x + 2)(x + 2)`

## F. Factoring the Sum and Difference of Cubes


### Definition

Factoring the sum and difference of cubes is a form of factoring in which an expression of the form `a^3 + b^3` or `a^3 - b^3` is factored into two linear terms. This is done by using the identity `a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)` and `a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)`.

### Example

Let’s factor the expression `x^3 + 8`. Since the expression is of the form `a^3 + b^3`, we can apply the identity `a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)`. In this case, `a = x` and `b = 8`.

Therefore, `x^3 + 8 = (x + 8)(x^2 - 8x + 64)`

### Practice Problems

1. Factor `y^3 - 27`.

Solution: `y^3 - 27 = (y - 3)(y^2 + 3y + 9)`

2. Factor `u^3 + 125`.

Solution: `u^3 + 125 = (u + 5)(u^2 - 5u + 25)`

3. Factor `z^3 - 64`.

Solution: `z^3 - 64 = (z - 4)(z^2 + 4z + 16)`

## G. Factoring by Grouping


### What is Factoring by Grouping?
Factoring by grouping is a method of factoring polynomials that involves grouping terms together and factoring the common factor from each group. This method is useful when a polynomial has four or more terms that cannot be factored using the other methods.

### Examples
Let's look at an example of factoring by grouping. Consider the polynomial:

`2x^3 + 3x^2 - 5x - 6`

We can group the terms in pairs and factor out the common factor from each group:

`2x^3 + 3x^2 = 2x(x^2 + 3)`

`-5x - 6 = -2x(3x + 3)`

Now we can factor out the common factor of 2x from each group:

`2x(x^2 + 3) - 2x(3x + 3)`

`2x(x^2 - 3x - 3)`

Finally, we can factor the trinomial using the methods we have learned:

`2x(x - 3)(x + 1)`

### Practice Problems
Try factoring the following polynomials using the method of factoring by grouping.

1. `4x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x - 3`

`4x^3 + 5x^2 = 4x(x^2 + 5)`

`-2x - 3 = -2(x + 3/2)`

`4x(x^2 + 5) - 2(x + 3/2)`

`4x(x^2 - x - 3/2)`

`4x(x - 3/2)(x + 1)`

2. `2x^4 + 5x^3 - 8x^2 - 10x`

`2x^4 + 5x^3 = 2x(x^3 + 5x^2)`

`-8x^2 - 10x = -2x(4x^2 + 5x)`

`2x(x^3 + 5x^2) - 2x(4x^2 + 5x)`

`2x(x^3 - 4x^2 - 5x)`

`2x(x - 5)(x^2 + 4x)`

## A. Definition of Rational Expressions

### What is a Rational Expression?

A rational expression is an expression that can be written as a fraction, where the numerator and denominator are polynomials. It is also known as a fractional expression. A rational expression is said to be in its **simplest form** when the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

### Examples of Rational Expressions

Some examples of rational expressions are shown below.

- `2x + 3` / `x - 1`
- `x^2 + 5x + 6` / `x^2 - 2x - 3`
- `2x^2 + 4x` / `x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x`

### Simplifying Rational Expressions

Rational expressions can be simplified by factoring the numerator and denominator and cancelling out any common factors. For example, the rational expression `2x + 3` / `x - 1` can be simplified as follows:

- Factor the numerator and denominator:
  - Numerator: `2x + 3` = `(2x + 3)(x + 1)`
  - Denominator: `x - 1` = `(x - 1)(x + 1)`
- Cancel out the common factor `x + 1`:
  - Numerator: `(2x + 3)(x + 1)` = `2x + 3`
  - Denominator: `(x - 1)(x + 1)` = `x - 1`

The simplified rational expression is `2x + 3` / `x - 1`.

### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the rational expression `2x^2 + 5x + 6` / `x^2 - 2x - 3`.

- Factor the numerator and denominator:
  - Numerator: `2x^2 + 5x + 6` = `(2x + 3)(x + 2)`
  - Denominator: `x^2 - 2x - 3` = `(x - 3)(x + 1)`
- Cancel out the common factor `x + 1`:
  - Numerator: `(2x + 3)(x + 2)` = `2x + 3`
  - Denominator: `(x - 3)(x + 1)` = `x - 3`

The simplified rational expression is `2x + 3` / `x - 3`.

2. Simplify the rational expression `3x^2 + 5x + 2` / `x^2 - 4x + 3`.

- Factor the numerator and denominator:
  - Numerator: `3x^2 + 5x + 2` = `(3x + 1)(x + 2)`
  - Denominator: `x^2 - 4x + 3` = `(x - 3)(x - 1)`
- Cancel out the common factor `x - 1`:
  - Numerator: `(3x + 1)(x + 2)` = `3x + 1`
  - Denominator: `(x - 3)(x - 1)` = `x - 3`

The simplified rational expression is `3x + 1` / `x - 3`.

## B. Simplifying Rational Expressions


### What is Simplifying Rational Expressions?

Simplifying rational expressions is the process of reducing a rational expression to its simplest form. This is done by factoring out common factors, canceling out common factors, and reducing the expression to its lowest terms. A rational expression is in its simplest form when all common factors have been factored out, all fractions have been reduced to their lowest terms, and all denominators are prime numbers.

### How to Simplify Rational Expressions

Simplifying rational expressions can be done in a few steps:

1. Factor out common factors
2. Cancel out common factors
3. Reduce the expression to its lowest terms

#### Step 1: Factor Out Common Factors

The first step to simplifying a rational expression is to factor out any common factors. Common factors are factors that are shared between the numerator and denominator of the expression. For example, the expression `2x^2 + 8x + 4` has a common factor of `2x`, so it can be factored out as `2x (x + 4)`.

#### Step 2: Cancel Out Common Factors

The second step is to cancel out any common factors. This means that any factors that are shared between the numerator and denominator can be cancelled out. For example, if the expression is `2x/(x+2)`, the common factor of `x` can be cancelled out to give the simplified expression `2/(x+2)`.

#### Step 3: Reduce the Expression to its Lowest Terms

The final step is to reduce the expression to its lowest terms. This means that any fractions in the expression should be reduced to their simplest form. To reduce a fraction to its lowest terms, the numerator and denominator must be divided by their greatest common factor (GCF). For example, the fraction `3/6` can be reduced to its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCF of `3`, giving `1/2`.

### Examples

Here are some examples of simplifying rational expressions:

1. `2x/(x+2)`

    The common factor of `x` can be factored out and cancelled, giving the simplified expression `2/(x+2)`.

2. `3x^2 + 6x + 3`

    The common factor of `3` can be factored out, giving the simplified expression `3(x^2 + 2x + 1)`.

3. `2/9`

    The fraction can be reduced to its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCF of `2`, giving `1/9`.

### Practice Problems

Try simplifying the following rational expressions:

1. `4x^2 + 8x + 4`

2. `3x/(x+3)`

3. `5/10`

### Answers

1. `4(x^2 + 2x + 1)`

2. `3/(x+3)`

3. `1/2`

## C. Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions


### Definition
A rational expression is an expression that can be written as a fraction with a numerator and a denominator. The numerator and denominator can contain polynomials, which are expressions made up of terms with variables and constants.

### Multiplying Rational Expressions
When multiplying two rational expressions, the numerator and denominator of each expression are multiplied together. This is the same as multiplying two fractions.

For example, to multiply the rational expressions `(x^2 + 2x + 1) / (x + 1)` and `(x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x - 2)`, the numerators and denominators of each expression are multiplied together:

`(x^2 + 2x + 1) / (x + 1) * (x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x - 2)`

`(x^2 + 2x + 1) * (x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x + 1) * (x - 2)`

`(x^4 - x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x + 1) / (x^2 - 2x + 2)`

### Dividing Rational Expressions
When dividing two rational expressions, the numerator of the first expression is multiplied by the denominator of the second expression, and the denominator of the first expression is multiplied by the numerator of the second expression. This is the same as in dividing two fractions.

For example, to divide the rational expressions `(x^2 + 2x + 1) / (x + 1)` and `(x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x - 2)`, the numerator of the first expression is multiplied by the denominator of the second expression, and the denominator of the first expression is multiplied by the numerator of the second expression:

`(x^2 + 2x + 1) / (x + 1) / (x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x - 2)`

`(x^2 + 2x + 1) * (x - 2) / (x + 1) * (x^2 - 2x + 1)`

`(x^3 - x^2 - 2x + 2) / (x^2 - 3x + 2)`

### Simplifying Rational Expressions
When multiplying or dividing rational expressions, it is important to simplify the resulting expression. This can be done with the same techniques used to simplify polynomials.

For example, the expression `(x^3 - x^2 - 2x + 2) / (x^2 - 3x + 2)` can be simplified by factoring the numerator and denominator:

`(x^2 - x + 2)(x - 1) / (x - 2)(x - 1)`

The expression can then be simplified further by canceling out the common factor `(x - 1)`:

`(x^2 - x + 2) / (x - 2)`

### Practice Problems
1. Multiply the rational expressions `(x^2 + 2x + 1) / (x + 1)` and `(x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x - 2)`.

Answer: `(x^4 - x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x + 1) / (x^2 - 2x + 2)`

2. Divide the rational expressions `(x^2 + 2x + 1) / (x + 1)` and `(x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x - 2)`.

Answer: `(x^3 - x^2 - 2x + 2) / (x^2 - 3x + 2)`

3. Simplify the expression `(x^3 - x^2 - 2x + 2) / (x^2 - 3x + 2)`.

Answer: `(x^2 - x + 2) / (x - 2)`

## D. Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions


### Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

Adding and subtracting rational expressions is similar to adding and subtracting fractions. The same rules apply, but with a few extra steps. We will go over the basics of adding and subtracting rational expressions here.

#### Like Denominators

When the denominators of two rational expressions are the same, the process is the same as adding fractions. All you have to do is add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

For example, if we have the following rational expressions:

$$\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x + 6} + \frac{x}{x^2 - 5x + 6}$$

We can add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:

$$\frac{2x + x}{x^2 - 5x + 6} = \frac{3x}{x^2 - 5x + 6}$$

#### Unlike Denominators

When the denominators of two rational expressions are different, we have to find a common denominator before we can add them. To do this, we will use the LCD (Least Common Denominator). The LCD is the smallest number that is divisible by both denominators.

For example, if we have the following rational expressions:

$$\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x + 6} + \frac{3x}{x^2 - 3x + 2}$$

We can find the LCD by multiplying the denominators together:

$$(x^2 - 5x + 6)(x^2 - 3x + 2) = x^4 - 8x^3 + 14x^2 - 10x + 12$$

Now that we have the LCD, we can rewrite each rational expression with the LCD as the denominator:

$$\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x + 6} + \frac{3x}{x^2 - 3x + 2} = \frac{2x(x^2 - 3x + 2) + 3x(x^2 - 5x + 6)}{x^4 - 8x^3 + 14x^2 - 10x + 12}$$

Now that we have our rational expressions written with the same denominator, we can add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:

$$\frac{2x(x^2 - 3x + 2) + 3x(x^2 - 5x + 6)}{x^4 - 8x^3 + 14x^2 - 10x + 12} = \frac{2x^3 - 7x^2 + 12x + 3x^2 - 15x + 18}{x^4 - 8x^3 + 14x^2 - 10x + 12}$$

$$= \frac{2x^3 - 4x^2 + 30x}{x^4 - 8x^3 + 14x^2 - 10x + 12}$$

#### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the following expression:

$$\frac{3x}{x^2 - 4x + 3} + \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x + 6}$$

Answer: $\frac{5x(x - 3) + 6(x - 2)}{(x - 3)(x - 2)(x + 1)} = \frac{5x^2 - 17x + 6}{(x - 3)(x - 2)(x + 1)}$

2. Simplify the following expression:

$$\frac{2x^2 + 3x}{x^2 + 5x + 6} - \frac{3x^2 - 5x}{x^2 + 3x + 2}$$

Answer: $\frac{2x^4 + 8x^3 + 11x^2 - 15x}{(x + 2)(x + 1)(x + 3)} = \frac{2x^4 + 8x^3 + 11x^2 - 15x}{(x + 2)(x + 1)(x + 3)}$

## E. Solving Rational Equations


### Introduction

A rational equation is an equation that contains one or more rational expressions, which are expressions that contain fractions. In this section, we will discuss how to solve rational equations. We will use algebraic methods to solve these equations, such as factoring, combining like terms, and using the zero product property.

### Steps for Solving Rational Equations

1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms and factoring.
2. Clear any fractions from the equation by multiplying each side of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) of all fractions in the equation.
3. Use the zero product property or factoring to solve the equation.
4. Check your answer by substituting it back into the original equation.

### Example

Let's solve the following equation:

$$\frac{2x+3}{x-2} = \frac{x+2}{x+3}$$

1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms and factoring.

$$\frac{2x+3}{x-2} = \frac{x+2}{x+3}$$

$$\frac{2x+3}{x-2} = \frac{x+2}{x+3} \cdot \frac{x-2}{x-2}$$

$$\frac{2x+3}{x-2} \cdot \frac{x-2}{x-2} = \frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{(x+3)(x-2)}$$

$$2x+3 = x+2$$

2. Clear any fractions from the equation by multiplying each side of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) of all fractions in the equation.

Since there are no fractions in the equation, we can skip this step.

3. Use the zero product property or factoring to solve the equation.

We can solve this equation by using the zero product property. We know that if the product of two factors is equal to zero, then at least one of the factors must be equal to zero.

$$2x+3=x+2$$

$$2x-x=2-3$$

$$x= -1$$

4. Check your answer by substituting it back into the original equation.

$$\frac{2x+3}{x-2} = \frac{x+2}{x+3}$$

$$\frac{2(-1)+3}{(-1)-2} = \frac{(-1)+2}{(-1)+3}$$

$$\frac{1}{-3} = \frac{1}{-2}$$

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our answer is correct.

## F. Complex Fractions


### Definition of Complex Fractions
A complex fraction is a fraction that contains one or more fractions in its numerator, denominator, or both. In other words, it is a fraction of a fraction. An example of a complex fraction is:

$$\frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{5}{6}}$$

In this example, there are two fractions in the numerator and denominator.

### Simplifying Complex Fractions
To simplify complex fractions, we must first simplify the fractions within the numerator and denominator. If the numerator and denominator have any common factors, we can cancel them out.

For example, let's simplify the following complex fraction:

$$\frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{5}{6}}$$

The fractions in the numerator and denominator can both be simplified by canceling out the common factor of 3.

$$\frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{5}{6}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{5}{6}}$$

### Multiplying and Dividing Complex Fractions
To multiply complex fractions, we must first multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

For example, let's multiply the following two complex fractions:

$$\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{5}{7}} \times \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{8}{9}}$$

First, we multiply the numerators together:

$$\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{8}{15}$$

Then, we multiply the denominators together:

$$\frac{5}{7} \times \frac{8}{9} = \frac{40}{63}$$

Finally, we combine the numerator and denominator to get the answer:

$$\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{5}{7}} \times \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{8}{9}} = \frac{\frac{8}{15}}{\frac{40}{63}}$$

To divide complex fractions, we must first invert the second fraction and then multiply the two fractions together.

For example, let's divide the following two complex fractions:

$$\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{5}{7}} \div \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{8}{9}}$$

First, we invert the second fraction:

$$\frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{8}{9}} \rightarrow \frac{\frac{9}{8}}{\frac{5}{4}}$$

Then, we multiply the two fractions together:

$$\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{5}{7}} \times \frac{\frac{9}{8}}{\frac{5}{4}}$$

First, we multiply the numerators together:

$$\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{9}{8} = \frac{18}{24}$$

Then, we multiply the denominators together:

$$\frac{5}{7} \times \frac{5}{4} = \frac{25}{28}$$

Finally, we combine the numerator and denominator to get the answer:

$$\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{5}{7}} \div \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{8}{9}} = \frac{\frac{18}{24}}{\frac{25}{28}}$$

### Adding and Subtracting Complex Fractions
To add or subtract complex fractions, we must first convert the fractions to have a common denominator.

For example, let's add the following two complex fractions:

$$\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{5}{7}} + \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{8}{9}}$$

First, we convert the fractions to have a common denominator:

$$\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{5}{7}} \rightarrow \frac{\frac{14}{21}}{\frac{35}{63}}$$

$$\frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{8}{9}} \rightarrow \frac{\frac{16}{45}}{\frac{35}{63}}$$

Then, we add the numerators together and keep the same denominator:

$$\frac{\frac{14}{21}}{\frac{35}{

## G. Graphing Rational Functions

### Definition

A rational function is a function that can be expressed as the ratio of two polynomials. Rational functions are continuous everywhere except at the zeros of the denominator.

### Graphing Rational Functions

When graphing rational functions, there are several steps to take:

1. Identify the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
2. Find the x-intercepts and y-intercepts.
3. Find the holes (where the domain of the function is not defined).
4. Determine the end behavior of the graph.
5. Graph the function.

#### Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes

Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of a rational function is equal to zero. The x-value of the vertical asymptote is the x-intercept of the denominator.

Horizontal asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. The y-value of the horizontal asymptote is the y-intercept of the numerator.

#### x-Intercepts and y-Intercepts

The x-intercepts of a rational function are the zeros of the numerator. The y-intercept of a rational function is the y-intercept of the numerator.

#### Holes

Holes occur when the denominator of a rational function is equal to zero, but the numerator is not. The x-value of the hole is the x-intercept of the denominator.

#### End Behavior

The end behavior of a rational function is determined by the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the function approaches positive or negative infinity as x approaches positive or negative infinity. If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, the function approaches zero as x approaches positive or negative infinity.

#### Graphing the Function

Once the vertical and horizontal asymptotes, x-intercepts, y-intercepts, holes, and end behavior have been determined, the graph of the rational function can be drawn.

### Example

Consider the rational function

$$f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 + 3x - 18}$$

1. Identify the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

The vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator is equal to zero. The x-intercepts of the denominator are $x = 3$ and $x = -6$. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are $x = 3$ and $x = -6$.

The degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, so the horizontal asymptote is the y-intercept of the numerator, which is $y = 3$.

2. Find the x-intercepts and y-intercepts.

The x-intercepts of the numerator are $x = 2$ and $x = -3$. Therefore, the x-intercepts of the rational function are $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.

The y-intercept of the numerator is $y = 3$. Therefore, the y-intercept of the rational function is $y = 3$.

3. Find the holes.

The holes occur when the denominator is equal to zero, but the numerator is not. The x-intercepts of the denominator are $x = 3$ and $x = -6$. Therefore, the holes are $x = 3$ and $x = -6$.

4. Determine the end behavior of the graph.

The degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, so the function approaches positive or negative infinity as x approaches positive or negative infinity.

5. Graph the function.

The graph of the rational function is shown below.

![Graph of Rational Function](graph-of-rational-function.png)

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the rational function $$f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 5x - 6}{x^2 - 4x + 3}$$

2. Graph the rational function $$f(x) = \frac{3x^3 - 7x^2 + 8x - 4}{x^2 - 6x + 9}$$

3. Graph the rational function $$f(x) = \frac{2x^

## H. Applications of Rational Expressions

### Introduction
Rational expressions are used in a variety of applications, from engineering and science to economics and finance. They can be used to model complex systems and to analyze data. In this section, we will explore a few of the applications of rational expressions.

### Engineering and Science
Rational expressions are used extensively in engineering and science. For example, they are used to model the behavior of electrical circuits, where the current and voltage are related by a rational expression. They are also used to model the behavior of mechanical systems, such as a pendulum, where the position and velocity are related by a rational expression.

### Economics and Finance
Rational expressions are also used in economics and finance. For example, they can be used to model the supply and demand for a product, where the price and quantity are related by a rational expression. They can also be used to model the relationship between interest rates and investments, where the return on investment is related by a rational expression.

### Data Analysis
Rational expressions can be used to analyze data. For example, they can be used to fit a line to data points, where the line is described by a rational expression. They can also be used to model the relationship between two variables, where the relationship is described by a rational expression.

### Practice Problems
1. Solve the following equation for x: $$\frac{x^2+2x-3}{x+1}=2$$

2. Simplify the following expression: $$\frac{2x^2+3x-4}{x^2+5x+6}$$

3. Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (2,3) and (4,5).

4. Given the following points: (2,3), (3,5), (4,7), (5,9), find the equation of the line that best fits the data.

5. Find the equation of the circle with center (3,2) and radius 5.

# 9. Radical Expressions


## A. Definition of Radical Expressions

### What are Radical Expressions?

Radical expressions are mathematical expressions that involve roots, or radicals. A radical is the root of a number, which is the number that when multiplied by itself a certain number of times (the index) will equal the original number.

The most common type of radical is the square root, which is the root of a number that when multiplied by itself will equal the original number. The square root is denoted by the symbol `√`. For example, the square root of 16 is 4, denoted as `√16 = 4`.

Other types of radicals include cube roots, fourth roots, and higher roots. The cube root of 8 is denoted as `3√8 = 2`, since when 2 is multiplied by itself three times, it equals 8.

### What is the Simplest Form of a Radical Expression?

The simplest form of a radical expression has three parts: a coefficient (or number in front of the radical sign), a radical sign, and a radicand (the number inside the radical sign).

For example, the simplest form of `3√8` is `2√2`, since when 2 is multiplied by itself three times, it equals 8.

The simplest form of a radical expression is the form in which the radicand is the smallest number possible and cannot be further simplified.

### What is the Index of a Radical Expression?

The index of a radical expression is the number of times that the radicand must be multiplied by itself in order to equal the original number. For example, the index of `3√8` is 3, since when 2 is multiplied by itself three times, it equals 8.

### What is the Coefficient of a Radical Expression?

The coefficient of a radical expression is the number that is multiplied by the radicand. For example, the coefficient of `3√8` is 3, since 3 is multiplied by the radicand, which is 2.

### Practice Problems

1. Simplify `7√14`

Answer: `2√7`

2. What is the index of `2√18`?

Answer: 3

## B. Simplifying Radical Expressions


### Definition of Simplifying

Simplifying a radical expression means to make the expression easier to work with by reducing the number of radicals in the expression. To do this, we must identify like radicals and combine them.

### Like Radicals

Like radicals are radicals that have the same index (the small number written in the upper right corner of the radical) and the same radicand (the number or expression inside the radical).

For example, the following are all like radicals:
```
√25,  5√1, 25√1
```

### Combining Like Radicals

To combine like radicals, we add or subtract the coefficients (the numbers that appear outside the radicals) and keep the same index and radicand.

For example:
```
3√8 + 5√8 = (3 + 5)√8 = 8√8
```

We can also combine like radicals when the radicand is not a perfect square. In this case, we must factor the radicand before combining.

For example:
```
2√6 + 4√6 = (2 + 4)√6 = 6√6
```

We can also combine like radicals with different coefficients and radicands.

For example:
```
3√15 + 5√10 = (3√15 + 5√15) + (5√15 - 5√15) = 8√15
```

### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the following expression:
```
3√25 + 5√25
```

Answer: 8√25

2. Simplify the following expression:
```
2√6 + 4√6
```

Answer: 6√6

## C. Adding and Subtracting Radical Expressions

### Adding and Subtracting Radicals

Adding and subtracting radical expressions is very similar to adding and subtracting polynomials. The only difference is that radical expressions contain radicals, which must be simplified.

To add or subtract radical expressions, first simplify the radicals. Then combine like terms.

**Example 1**

Add the following radical expressions:

`√2 + √3 + √6`

First, simplify the radicals:

`√2 + √3 + 2√3`

Now combine like terms:

`√2 + 3√3`

**Example 2**

Subtract the following radical expressions:

`3√5 - 2√5`

First, simplify the radicals:

`3√5 - 2√5`

Now combine like terms:

`√5`

### Practice Problems

1. Add the following radical expressions:

`√7 + 3√7 + 4√7`

Answer: `8√7`

2. Subtract the following radical expressions:

`5√8 - 3√8`

Answer: `2√8`

## D. Multiplying and Dividing Radical Expressions


### Multiplying Radical Expressions

Multiplying radical expressions is a relatively straightforward process. The general rule is to multiply the numerical coefficients, and then multiply the radicals.

For example, consider the following expression:

`3√4 * 5√2`

The numerical coefficients are 3 and 5, so the numerical coefficient of the product is 3 * 5 = 15.

The radicals are 4 and 2, so the radical of the product is 4 * 2 = 8.

Therefore, the product of the two expressions is `15√8`.

It is important to note that the numerical coefficient and the radical in the product are separate numbers. For example, the product of `3√4 * 5√2` is not `15√4` but rather `15√8`.

It is also important to note that the order of multiplication does not matter. For example, `3√4 * 5√2` and `5√2 * 3√4` will both yield the same result: `15√8`.

### Dividing Radical Expressions

Dividing radical expressions is slightly more complicated than multiplying them. The general rule is to divide the numerical coefficients, and then take the nth root of the radical, where n is the root of the expression being divided.

For example, consider the following expression:

`15√8 / 3√4`

The numerical coefficients are 15 and 3, so the numerical coefficient of the quotient is 15 / 3 = 5.

The radicals are 8 and 4, so the radical of the quotient is the fourth root of 8, which is 2.

Therefore, the quotient of the two expressions is `5√2`.

It is important to note that the numerical coefficient and the radical in the quotient are separate numbers. For example, the quotient of `15√8 / 3√4` is not `5√8` but rather `5√2`.

It is also important to note that the order of division does matter. For example, `15√8 / 3√4` and `3√4 / 15√8` will yield different results: `5√2` and `1/5√2`, respectively.

### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the following expression: `2√3 * 5√2`

Answer: `10√6`

## E. Rationalizing the Denominator


### Definition

Rationalizing the denominator is the process of transforming a fraction with a radical in the denominator into an equivalent fraction with no radicals in the denominator. This is necessary in order to simplify expressions and solve equations.

### Examples

To illustrate this process, let's consider the fraction $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$. To rationalize the denominator, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same expression that will eliminate the radical in the denominator. In this case, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:

$$\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$$

Now, the denominator no longer contains a radical, and the expression is simplified.

Another example is $\frac{3}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}}$. To rationalize the denominator, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by an expression that will eliminate the radical in the denominator. In this case, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}$:

$$\frac{3}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{3(\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3})}{2 - 3}$$

Now, the denominator no longer contains a radical, and the expression is simplified.

### Practice Problems

1. Rationalize the denominator of $\frac{5}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}}$.

$$\frac{5}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{5(\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3})}{2 - 3}$$

2. Rationalize the denominator of $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}}$.

$$\frac{2}{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{2(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})}{3 + 2}$$

## F. Solving Radical Equations


### What is a Radical Equation?
A radical equation is an equation that contains a radical expression, also known as a root expression. A radical expression is an expression that contains a root, such as a square root, cube root, fourth root, etc. A radical equation is an equation that must be solved by isolating the radical expression on one side of the equation.

### Solving Radical Equations
Solving radical equations is a process of isolating the radical expression on one side of the equation and then solving for the variable. To solve a radical equation, we must use the following steps:

1. Isolate the radical expression on one side of the equation
2. Square both sides of the equation
3. Solve the resulting equation

Let's look at an example:

Solve for x in the equation:

$$\sqrt{x+2} = 3$$

1. Isolate the radical expression on one side of the equation:

$$\sqrt{x+2} - 3 = 0$$

2. Square both sides of the equation:

$$(\sqrt{x+2} - 3)^2 = 0$$

3. Solve the resulting equation:

$$x+2 = 9$$

$$x = 7$$

Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 7.

### Practice Problem

Solve for x in the equation:

$$\sqrt{x-5} = 2$$

1. Isolate the radical expression on one side of the equation:

$$\sqrt{x-5} - 2 = 0$$

2. Square both sides of the equation:

$$(\sqrt{x-5} - 2)^2 = 0$$

3. Solve the resulting equation:

$$x-5 = 4$$

$$x = 9$$

Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 9.

## G. Complex Radical Expressions


### Definition of Complex Radical Expressions

Complex radical expressions are expressions that contain both a radical and a non-radical term. They are often written in the form of a fraction with a radical in the numerator or denominator. An example of a complex radical expression is $\frac{2\sqrt{x} + 3}{x-4}$.

### Simplifying Complex Radical Expressions

Complex radical expressions can be simplified by first rationalizing the denominator. This involves multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. For example, to simplify $\frac{2\sqrt{x} + 3}{x-4}$, we would multiply the numerator and denominator by $\frac{x+4}{x+4}$ to get $\frac{2x\sqrt{x} + 12}{x^{2} - 16}$.

Once the denominator is rationalized, we can use the same methods for simplifying radical expressions to simplify the numerator. For example, we can use the distributive property to rewrite the numerator as $2x\sqrt{x} + 12 = 2\sqrt{x}(x+6)$.

### Adding and Subtracting Complex Radical Expressions

To add or subtract complex radical expressions, first rationalize the denominator of each expression. Then, combine the numerators and denominators to form a new fraction. For example, to add $\frac{2\sqrt{x} + 3}{x-4}$ and $\frac{3\sqrt{x} + 5}{x-2}$, we would first rationalize the denominators to get $\frac{2\sqrt{x} + 3}{x^{2} - 16}$ and $\frac{3\sqrt{x} + 5}{x^{2} - 4}$. Then, we can combine the numerators and denominators to get $\frac{2\sqrt{x} + 3x + 5x + 15}{x^{2} - 16} = \frac{5\sqrt{x} + 18}{x^{2} - 16}$.

### Multiplying and Dividing Complex Radical Expressions

To multiply or divide complex radical expressions, first rationalize the denominators of both expressions. Then, use the same methods for multiplying or dividing radical expressions to simplify the numerators. For example, to multiply $\frac{2\sqrt{x} + 3}{x-4}$ and $\frac{3\sqrt{x} + 5}{x-2}$, we would first rationalize the denominators to get $\frac{2\sqrt{x} + 3}{x^{2} - 16}$ and $\frac{3\sqrt{x} + 5}{x^{2} - 4}$. Then, we can multiply the numerators and denominators to get $\frac{6x\sqrt{x} + 15\sqrt{x} + 10x + 15}{x^{2} - 16x + 4}$.

### Solving Complex Radical Equations

Solving complex radical equations involves first isolating the radical expression on one side of the equation. Then, the equation can be solved by rationalizing the denominator and then using the same methods for solving radical equations.

For example, to solve the equation $2\sqrt{x} + 3 = x-4$, we can isolate the radical expression on one side of the equation by subtracting $x-4$ from both sides to get $2\sqrt{x} = -7$. We can then rationalize the denominator to get $2x = -7$, which can be solved by dividing both sides by $2$ to get $x = -3.5$.

### Applications of Complex Radical Expressions

Complex radical expressions are used in a variety of applications, including physics, engineering, and economics. In physics, they are used to calculate the energy of a system, and in engineering, they are used to calculate the force of an object. In economics, they are used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.

## H. Applications of Radical Expressions

### Introduction
Radical expressions are used in a variety of applications in math and science, ranging from simple equations to complex calculations. In this section, we will explore some of the most common applications of radical expressions.

### Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean theorem is one of the most widely used applications of radical expressions. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the longest side. This can be expressed mathematically as:

```
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

Where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two shorter sides and `c` is the length of the longest side. To solve for `c`, we must take the square root of both sides of the equation, resulting in:

```
c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
```

This equation can be used to calculate the length of the longest side of a right triangle, given the lengths of the two shorter sides.

### Quadratic Equations
Quadratic equations are equations of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are real numbers and `x` is the variable. To solve these equations, we must use the quadratic formula, which is expressed as:

```
x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
```

This formula requires us to take the square root of `b^2 - 4ac`, so it is an application of radical expressions.

### Volume of a Cylinder
The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula `V = πr^2h`, where `V` is the volume, `r` is the radius of the cylinder, and `h` is the height of the cylinder. To solve for `r` or `h`, we must take the square root of both sides of the equation. If we are solving for `r`, the equation becomes:

```
r = sqrt(V / πh)
```

### Practice Problems
1. Solve the following equation: `2x^2 + 8x + 3 = 0`

  Answer: `x = (-8 +- sqrt(64 - 24)) / 4`

  `x = (-8 +- sqrt(40)) / 4`

  `x = (-8 +- 2sqrt(10)) / 4`

  `x = (-8 +- 2(sqrt(5) + sqrt(2))) / 4`

  `x = (-8 +- (2sqrt(5) + 2sqrt(2))) / 4`

  `x = (-4 - 2sqrt(5), -4 + 2sqrt(5))`

2. Find the length of the longest side of a right triangle with sides of length 5 and 12.

  Answer: `c = sqrt(5^2 + 12^2)`

  `c = sqrt(169)`

  `c = 13`

# 10. Complex Numbers


## A. Introduction to Complex Numbers


### What are Complex Numbers?
Complex numbers are a combination of a real number and an imaginary number, usually written in the form of a + bi, where a is the real part and bi is the imaginary part. The imaginary part is a multiple of the imaginary unit, i, which is defined as the square root of -1.

### Examples of Complex Numbers
Some examples of complex numbers are:
- 2 + 3i
- -5 + 4i
- 0 + 5i

### Properties of Complex Numbers
Complex numbers have a few unique properties that make them different from real numbers.

- **Addition**: When adding two complex numbers, the real parts are added together and the imaginary parts are added together. For example: (2 + 3i) + (4 + 7i) = (6 + 10i).

- **Subtraction**: When subtracting two complex numbers, the real parts are subtracted and the imaginary parts are subtracted. For example: (2 + 3i) - (4 + 7i) = (-2 - 4i).

- **Multiplication**: When multiplying two complex numbers, the real parts and imaginary parts are multiplied separately. For example: (2 + 3i) x (4 + 7i) = (8 + 22i + 12i + 21i^2). Since i^2 = -1, the equation can be simplified to (8 + 22i - 21).

- **Division**: When dividing two complex numbers, the numerator and denominator are both multiplied by the complex conjugate of the denominator. For example: (2 + 3i) / (4 + 7i) = ((2 + 3i)(4 - 7i)) / (4 + 7i)(4 - 7i)). The equation can be simplified to (14 + 5i) / 65.

### Practice Problems
1. Add (2 + 3i) and (4 + 7i).
2. Subtract (2 + 3i) and (4 + 7i).
3. Multiply (2 + 3i) and (4 + 7i).
4. Divide (2 + 3i) and (4 + 7i).

## B. Representing Complex Numbers


### Complex Numbers

Complex numbers are numbers that can be written in the form `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers and `i` is the imaginary unit, which is equal to the square root of `-1`. The number `a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part.

### Examples

1. `3 + 2i`
2. `5 - 4i`
3. `2 + 3i`

### Operations with Complex Numbers

Complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided just like any other numbers.

#### Adding and Subtracting Complex Numbers

When adding and subtracting complex numbers, the real parts are added or subtracted and the imaginary parts are added or subtracted separately.

For example, to add `3 + 2i` and `5 - 4i`, we add the real parts (3 + 5) and the imaginary parts (2 - 4) separately. This gives us `8 - 2i`.

#### Multiplying and Dividing Complex Numbers

When multiplying and dividing complex numbers, it is helpful to remember the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), which is used to multiply two binomials.

For example, to multiply `3 + 2i` and `5 - 4i`, we FOIL them out:

```
(3 + 2i)(5 - 4i) =
15 - 12i + 10i - 8i^2 =
15 - 22i - 8(-1) =
15 - 22i + 8
```

So the product of `3 + 2i` and `5 - 4i` is `15 - 22i + 8`.

### Complex Conjugates

The complex conjugate of a complex number `a + bi` is `a - bi`. This is the same number with the sign of the imaginary part changed.

The complex conjugate of `3 + 2i` is `3 - 2i`.

### Roots of Complex Numbers

The nth root of a complex number `a + bi` is a complex number `x + yi` such that `(x + yi)^n = a + bi`.

For example, the square root of `3 + 2i` is `1.3228756555322954 + 0.7453559924999299i`.

### Polar Form of Complex Numbers

The polar form of a complex number `a + bi` is `r(cos(θ) + isin(θ))`, where `r` is the magnitude of the complex number and `θ` is the argument of the complex number.

The polar form of `3 + 2i` is `2.23606797749979(cos(1.1071487177940904) + isin(1.1071487177940904))`.

### De Moivre’s Theorem

De Moivre’s theorem states that for any complex number `z` and any positive integer `n`, `z^n = r^n(cos(nθ) + isin(nθ))`, where `r` is the magnitude of `z` and `θ` is the argument of `z`.

For example, to find the fourth power of `3 + 2i`, we can use De Moivre’s theorem:

```
(3 + 2i)^4 =
2.23606797749979^4(cos(4(1.1071487177940904)) + isin(4(1.1071487177940904))) =
80.71764390819091(cos(4.428596311781636) + isin(4.428596311781636))
```

So the fourth power of `3 + 2i` is `80.71764390819091(cos(4.428596311781636) + isin(4.428596311781636))`.

### Euler’s Formula

Euler’s formula states that for any complex number `z`, `z = r(cos(θ) + isin(θ)) = r(e^(iθ))`, where `r` is the magnitude of `z` and `θ` is the argument of `z`.

## C. Operations with Complex Numbers

### Addition and Subtraction

Complex numbers can be added and subtracted in the same way as real numbers. When adding or subtracting two complex numbers, add or subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.

For example, to add `2 + 3i` and `4 - i`, we first add the real parts: `2 + 4 = 6` and then add the imaginary parts: `3i - i = 2i`. The result is `6 + 2i`.

### Multiplication

Complex numbers can be multiplied in the same way as binomials. To multiply two complex numbers, first multiply the real parts and the imaginary parts separately, then add the two products together.

For example, to multiply `2 + 3i` and `4 - i`, we first multiply the real parts: `2 * 4 = 8` and then multiply the imaginary parts: `3i * -i = -3`. The result is `8 - 3i`.

### Division

Complex numbers can be divided in the same way as fractions. To divide two complex numbers, multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.

For example, to divide `2 + 3i` by `4 - i`, we first multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator: `(2 + 3i) * (4 + i) = 8 + 5i`. Then divide the real parts: `8 / (4 * 4) = 2` and divide the imaginary parts: `5i / (4 * 4) = i/2`. The result is `2 + i/2`.

### Practice Problems

1. Add `2 + 4i` and `3 - 5i`.
2. Multiply `2 + 3i` and `4 - i`.
3. Divide `2 + 3i` by `4 - i`.

Answers:
1. `5 - i`
2. `8 - 3i`
3. `2 + i/2`

## D. Complex Conjugates


### Introduction

Complex conjugates are an important concept in algebra and are used to simplify equations and solve problems involving complex numbers. A complex conjugate is a pair of complex numbers that have the same real part and imaginary part of opposite sign. For example, the complex conjugate of 3 + 4i is 3 - 4i.

### Representation

A complex conjugate is represented as the sum of a complex number and its conjugate. For example, the complex conjugate of 3 + 4i can be written as 3 + 4i + 3 - 4i = 6.

### Operations

Complex conjugates can be used to simplify equations and solve problems involving complex numbers. For example, if we want to find the product of two complex numbers, we can use their conjugates to simplify the equation. Let's say we want to find the product of 3 + 4i and 5 + 6i. We can use the conjugates to simplify the equation as follows:

```
(3 + 4i)(5 + 6i) = (3 + 4i)(5 - 6i) + (3 - 4i)(5 + 6i)
                  = (3 - 4i)(3 - 4i) + (5 + 6i)(5 + 6i)
                  = 25 + 36i - 12i - 16 = 9 + 20i
```

This technique can also be used to simplify equations involving radicals. For example, if we want to simplify the equation √(2 + 3i), we can use the conjugate to simplify the equation as follows:

```
√(2 + 3i) = √(2 + 3i) + √(2 - 3i)
          = √(4 + 0i) + √(4 - 0i)
          = 2√2
```

### Practice Problems

1. Find the product of 4 + 3i and 3 - 2i.

```
(4 + 3i)(3 - 2i) = (4 + 3i)(3 + 2i) + (4 - 3i)(3 - 2i)
                  = (4 + 3i)(4 + 3i) + (3 - 2i)(3 - 2i)
                  = 16 + 12i - 6i - 4 = 12 + 8i
```

2. Simplify the equation √(3 + 5i).

```
√(3 + 5i) = √(3 + 5i) + √(3 - 5i)
          = √(6 + 0i) + √(6 - 0i)
          = 2√3
```

## E. Roots of Complex Numbers


### Introduction

Complex numbers can have multiple roots. The number of roots a complex number has is determined by its degree. For example, a quadratic equation has two roots, while a cubic equation has three roots. Finding the roots of a complex number is a fundamental part of algebra.

### Finding the Roots

The roots of a complex number can be found using the following steps:

1. Write the complex number in standard form: $a + bi$
2. Find the magnitude of the complex number: $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
3. Find the argument of the complex number: $\arctan(b/a)$
4. Calculate the roots using the formula:

$$z = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \cdot (\cos(\theta + 2\pi n) + i \sin(\theta + 2\pi n))$$

where $\theta$ is the argument of the complex number and $n$ is an integer.

### Example

Let's find the roots of the complex number $3 + 4i$.

1. Write the complex number in standard form: $3 + 4i$
2. Find the magnitude of the complex number: $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$
3. Find the argument of the complex number: $\arctan(4/3) = 53.13^{\circ}$
4. Calculate the roots using the formula:

$$z = 5 \cdot (\cos(53.13^{\circ} + 2\pi n) + i \sin(53.13^{\circ} + 2\pi n))$$

where $n$ is an integer.

The two roots of the complex number are:

$$z_1 = 5 \cdot (\cos(53.13^{\circ}) + i \sin(53.13^{\circ})) = 2.19 + 4.07i$$

$$z_2 = 5 \cdot (\cos(106.26^{\circ}) + i \sin(106.26^{\circ})) = -2.19 - 4.07i$$

### Practice Problems

1. Find the roots of the complex number $2 - 3i$.
2. Find the roots of the complex number $4 + 4i$.
3. Find the roots of the complex number $-2 + 6i$.

### Solutions

1. The roots of the complex number $2 - 3i$ are:

$$z_1 = 5 \cdot (\cos(36.87^{\circ}) + i \sin(36.87^{\circ})) = 2.45 - 2.45i$$

$$z_2 = 5 \cdot (\cos(153.13^{\circ}) + i \sin(153.13^{\circ})) = -2.45 + 2.45i$$

2. The roots of the complex number $4 + 4i$ are:

$$z_1 = 8 \cdot (\cos(45^{\circ}) + i \sin(45^{\circ})) = 5.66 + 5.66i$$

$$z_2 = 8 \cdot (\cos(135^{\circ}) + i \sin(135^{\circ})) = -5.66 - 5.66i$$

3. The roots of the complex number $-2 + 6i$ are:

$$z_1 = 6.32 \cdot (\cos(55.36^{\circ}) + i \sin(55.36^{\circ})) = 1.17 + 5.52i$$

$$z_2 = 6.32 \cdot (\cos(124.64^{\circ}) + i \sin(124.64^{\circ})) = -3.17 - 3.17i$$

## F. Polar Form of Complex Numbers


### Introduction

Complex numbers can also be expressed in **polar form**. Polar form is a way of expressing complex numbers in terms of a length (radius) and an angle. This form is often more useful for calculations and for visualizing the complex number on a graph.

### Representing Complex Numbers in Polar Form

A complex number in polar form is represented by the expression:

$$ z = r \cdot (\cos \theta + i \cdot \sin \theta) $$

where:

- $r$ is the **radius** or **modulus** of the complex number
- $\theta$ is the **angle** of the complex number
- $\cos \theta$ is the **real part** of the complex number
- $\sin \theta$ is the **imaginary part** of the complex number

The radius $r$ is the distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number on the complex plane. The angle $\theta$ is the angle formed by a line from the origin to the point representing the complex number and the positive real axis.

### Operations with Complex Numbers in Polar Form

When working with complex numbers in polar form, there are several operations that can be performed.

#### Multiplication

To multiply two complex numbers in polar form, multiply the radii together and add the angles together:

$$ (r_1 \cdot (\cos \theta_1 + i \cdot \sin \theta_1)) \cdot (r_2 \cdot (\cos \theta_2 + i \cdot \sin \theta_2))  =  r_1 \cdot r_2 \cdot (\cos (\theta_1 + \theta_2) + i \cdot \sin (\theta_1 + \theta_2)) $$

#### Division

To divide two complex numbers in polar form, divide the radii and subtract the angles:

$$ \frac{r_1 \cdot (\cos \theta_1 + i \cdot \sin \theta_1)}{r_2 \cdot (\cos \theta_2 + i \cdot \sin \theta_2)}  =  \frac{r_1}{r_2} \cdot (\cos (\theta_1 - \theta_2) + i \cdot \sin (\theta_1 - \theta_2)) $$

#### Exponentiation

To raise a complex number in polar form to a power, raise the radius to the power and multiply the angle by the power:

$$ (r \cdot (\cos \theta + i \cdot \sin \theta))^n  =  r^n \cdot (\cos (n \cdot \theta) + i \cdot \sin (n \cdot \theta)) $$

### Examples

Let's look at some examples of converting complex numbers to polar form and performing operations with them.

#### Example 1

Convert the complex number $z = 3 + 4i$ to polar form.

We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the radius:

$$ r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5 $$

We can use the arctangent function to calculate the angle:

$$ \theta = \arctan \frac{4}{3} = 53.13^{\circ} $$

Therefore, the polar form of the complex number is:

$$ z = 5 \cdot (\cos 53.13^{\circ} + i \cdot \sin 53.13^{\circ}) $$

#### Example 2

Multiply the complex numbers $z_1 = 3 \cdot (\cos 30^{\circ} + i \cdot \sin 30^{\circ})$ and $z_2 = 4 \cdot (\cos 45^{\circ} + i \cdot \sin 45^{\circ})$.

Using the multiplication formula for polar form, we have:

$$ z_1 \cdot z_2 = (3 \cdot 4) \cdot (\cos (30^{\circ} + 45^{\circ}) + i \cdot \sin (30^{\circ} + 45^{\circ})) $$

$$ = 12 \cdot (\cos 75^{\circ} + i \cdot \sin 75^{\circ}) $$

## G. De Moivre’s Theorem


### Introduction

De Moivre's Theorem is a powerful tool for working with complex numbers and for solving equations involving complex numbers. It states that for any real number x and any positive integer n, the following equation holds:

$$ (\cos x + i \sin x)^n = \cos (nx) + i \sin (nx) $$

Here, i is the imaginary unit, equal to the square root of -1. This theorem allows us to easily calculate the powers of complex numbers, and can be used to solve many equations involving complex numbers.

### Example

Let's consider an example to illustrate how De Moivre's Theorem works. Let's say we want to calculate $(2 + 3i)^4$. Using De Moivre's Theorem, we can write:

$$ (2 + 3i)^4 = (\cos \pi + i \sin \pi)^4 = \cos (4 \pi) + i \sin (4 \pi) $$

Using a calculator, we can find that $\cos (4 \pi) = -1$ and $\sin (4 \pi) = 0$. Therefore, $(2 + 3i)^4 = -1 + 0i = -1$.

### Practice Problems

1. Use De Moivre's Theorem to calculate $(2 - 3i)^6$.
2. Use De Moivre's Theorem to calculate $(-1 + i)^5$.
3. Use De Moivre's Theorem to calculate $(\frac{\sqrt 3}{2} + \frac{i}{2})^3$.

### Solutions

1. $(2 - 3i)^6 = (\cos \pi - i \sin \pi)^6 = \cos (6 \pi) - i \sin (6 \pi) = -1 - 0i = -1$.
2. $(-1 + i)^5 = (-\cos \frac{\pi}{2} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{2})^5 = \cos (5 \frac{\pi}{2}) + i \sin (5 \frac{\pi}{2}) = -1 + 0i = -1$.
3. $(\frac{\sqrt 3}{2} + \frac{i}{2})^3 = (\cos \frac{\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{3})^3 = \cos (3 \frac{\pi}{3}) + i \sin (3 \frac{\pi}{3}) = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt 3}{2}i$.

## H. Euler’s Formula


### Overview

Euler's formula is a mathematical equation that expresses a relationship between a complex number and its trigonometric form. It is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who discovered it in 1748. The formula is expressed as:

$$e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i \sin\theta$$

Where $\theta$ is an angle and $i$ is the imaginary number. This equation can be used to solve a variety of problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering.

### Explanation

Euler's formula is a fundamental result in mathematics that connects complex numbers and trigonometric functions. It states that a complex number can be written as the sum of its real and imaginary components.

The formula can be derived from the definition of a complex number, which is a number of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary number $\sqrt{-1}$.

The formula can also be derived using the trigonometric identities for sine and cosine. The identity for sine is:

$$\sin\theta = \frac{e^{i\theta} - e^{-i\theta}}{2i}$$

And the identity for cosine is:

$$\cos\theta = \frac{e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}}{2}$$

Combining these two identities yields Euler's formula.

### Examples

Let's look at a few examples of how Euler's formula can be used to solve problems.

**Example 1:** Find the value of $e^{i\pi}$.

Using Euler's formula, we can write:

$$e^{i\pi} = \cos\pi + i \sin\pi$$

Since $\cos\pi = -1$ and $\sin\pi = 0$, we can write:

$$e^{i\pi} = -1 + 0i = -1$$

**Example 2:** Find the value of $\cos\frac{\pi}{4}$.

We can use Euler's formula to solve this problem. We can write:

$$e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin\frac{\pi}{4}$$

Since $\cos\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we can write:

$$e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = \sqrt{2}e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$$

Therefore, $\cos\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

### Practice Problems

1. Find the value of $e^{i\frac{\pi}{3}}$.
2. Find the value of $\cos\frac{\pi}{6}$.
3. Find the value of $\sin(2\pi)$.
4. Find the value of $\cos(-\frac{\pi}{2})$.

### Answers

1. $e^{i\frac{\pi}{3}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$
2. $\cos\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
3. $\sin(2\pi) = 0$
4. $\cos(-\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0$

# 11. Matrices


## A. Introduction to Matrices


### What is a Matrix?

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating data in mathematics and computer science. They are used to represent linear transformations, systems of equations, and other mathematical objects.

### Types of Matrices

Matrices come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common types of matrices are:

- **Square Matrices**: A matrix with the same number of rows and columns.
- **Rectangular Matrices**: A matrix with a different number of rows and columns.
- **Diagonal Matrices**: A matrix with all elements outside the main diagonal equal to zero.
- **Identity Matrices**: A square matrix with all elements on the main diagonal equal to one.
- **Symmetric Matrices**: A square matrix with elements outside the main diagonal equal to the elements on the main diagonal.

### Notation

Matrices are typically denoted by capital letters, such as A, B, and C. The elements of a matrix are denoted by lowercase letters with subscripts, such as a<sub>ij</sub>. The subscripts indicate the row and column of the element, where i is the row and j is the column.

For example, the matrix A below has 4 rows and 3 columns, and the element a<sub>23</sub> is equal to 5.

```
A =
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [10, 11, 12]
]
```

### Operations

Matrices can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. These operations can be used to solve systems of linear equations and other mathematical problems.

#### Addition and Subtraction

Matrices can be added and subtracted if they have the same shape. To add or subtract two matrices, add or subtract each corresponding element.

For example, to add the matrices A and B below, add each corresponding element.

```
A =
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [10, 11, 12]
]

B =
[
  [2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7],
  [8, 9, 10],
  [11, 12, 13]
]
```

The result is the matrix C, shown below.

```
C =
[
  [3, 5, 7],
  [9, 11, 13],
  [15, 17, 19],
  [21, 23, 25]
]
```

#### Multiplication

Matrices can be multiplied if the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. To multiply two matrices, multiply each element of the first matrix by each element of the second matrix and add the results.

For example, to multiply the matrices A and B below, multiply each element of the first matrix by each element of the second matrix and add the results.

```
A =
[
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
]

B =
[
  [5, 6],
  [7, 8]
]
```

The result is the matrix C, shown below.

```
C =
[
  [19, 22],
  [43, 50]
]
```

#### Division

Matrices can be divided if the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. To divide two matrices, multiply the inverse of the second matrix by the first matrix.

For example, to divide the matrices A and B below, multiply the inverse of the second matrix by the first matrix.

```
A =
[
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
]

B =
[
  [5, 6],
  [7, 8]
]
```

The result is the matrix C, shown below.

```
C =
[
  [-1, 0],
]
```


## B. Matrix Operations


### Definition

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. It is a powerful tool for performing mathematical operations on data sets.

### Addition and Subtraction

The most basic operations that can be performed on matrices are addition and subtraction. To add or subtract two matrices, they must have the same dimensions. That is, they must have the same number of rows and columns.

For example, to add two matrices A and B, each of size 2x2, the following must be done:

$$A + B = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} & b_{12} \\
b_{21} & b_{22}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} + b_{12} \\
a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} + b_{22}
\end{bmatrix}$$

Subtraction is done in a similar way.

### Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is a bit more complicated than addition and subtraction. To multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix.

For example, to multiply two matrices A and B, each of size 2x3 and 3x2 respectively, the following must be done:

$$A \cdot B = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} & b_{12} \\
b_{21} & b_{22} \\
b_{31} & b_{32}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21} + a_{13}b_{31} & a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22} + a_{13}b_{32} \\
a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21} + a_{23}b_{31} & a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22} + a_{23}b_{32}
\end{bmatrix}$$

### Division

Division of matrices is not possible in the same way as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Instead, division is done using the inverse of the matrix that is being divided by.

For example, to divide matrix A by matrix B, each of size 2x2, the following must be done:

$$A \div B = A \cdot B^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} & b_{12} \\
b_{21} & b_{22}
\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21} & a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22} \\
a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21} & a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22}
\end{bmatrix}$$

### Practice Problems

1. Add the following matrices:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
3 & 5 \\
2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 \\
6 & 2
\end{bmatrix}$$

Answer:

$$A + B = \begin{bmatrix}
3 + 1 & 5 + 4 \\
2 + 6 & 1 + 2
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 9 \\
8 & 3
\end{bmatrix}$$

2. Multiply the following matrices:

$$A =

## C. Matrix Representation


### Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. It is a powerful tool for representing and manipulating data and equations in mathematics.

A matrix is usually denoted by a capital letter, such as **A**. The size of a matrix is defined by the number of its rows and columns, which are referred to as its **dimensions**. A matrix with **m** rows and **n** columns is called an **m x n matrix** or an **m by n matrix**.

For example, the following is a 3 x 2 matrix:

```
A =
[
  a11 a12
  a21 a22
  a31 a32
]
```

### Matrix Elements

Each element in a matrix is identified by its row and column numbers. For example, the element **a11** in the matrix above is in the first row and first column. The element **a32** is in the third row and second column.

### Matrix Operations

Matrices can be added, subtracted, and multiplied. Addition and subtraction of matrices require that the two matrices have the same dimensions. Multiplication of two matrices requires that the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.

### Matrix Representation

Matrices are often represented using a shorthand notation. For example, the matrix above can be written as:

```
A =
[
  a11 a12
  a21 a22
  a31 a32
]
```

can be written as:

A =

| a11 a12 |
| a21 a22 |
| a31 a32 |

The vertical lines indicate the boundaries of the rows and columns.

In this notation, the elements in the matrix are represented by their row and column numbers. For example, **a11** is the element in the first row and first column, **a12** is the element in the first row and second column, and so on.

The same notation can also be used to represent a matrix with more than two columns or rows. For example, the following 4 x 3 matrix:

```
B =
[
  b11 b12 b13
  b21 b22 b23
  b31 b32 b33
  b41 b42 b43
]
```

can be written as:

B =

| b11 b12 b13 |
| b21 b22 b23 |
| b31 b32 b33 |
| b41 b42 b43 |

### Examples

Let's look at some examples of matrices and their representation.

#### Example 1

Consider the following matrix:

```
C =
[
  c11 c12 c13
  c21 c22 c23
  c31 c32 c33
]
```

It can be written as:

C =

| c11 c12 c13 |
| c21 c22 c23 |
| c31 c32 c33 |

#### Example 2

Consider the following matrix:

```
D =
[
  d11 d12 d13 d14
  d21 d22 d23 d24
  d31 d32 d33 d34
  d41 d42 d43 d44
]
```

It can be written as:

D =

| d11 d12 d13 d14 |
| d21 d22 d23 d24 |
| d31 d32 d33 d34 |
| d41 d42 d43 d44 |

```

Answer:

E =

| e11 e12 |
| e21 e22 |
| e31 e32 |
| e41 e42 |

  f51 f52 f53
]
```

Answer:

F =

| f11 f

## D. Inverse Matrices


### Introduction

An **inverse matrix** is a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in an identity matrix. In other words, the inverse matrix "undoes" the original matrix. An inverse matrix is denoted by the symbol $$A^{-1}$$.

### Finding the Inverse

The inverse of a matrix $$A$$ can be found by using the following formula:

$$A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A} \cdot \text{adj}(A)$$

where $$\det A$$ is the determinant of $$A$$ and $$\text{adj}(A)$$ is the **adjoint** or **adjoint matrix** of $$A$$.

The adjoint matrix is found by taking the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of $$A$$. The matrix of cofactors is found by taking the determinant of the minor matrix of each element of $$A$$.

### Example

Find the inverse of the following matrix:

$$A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 10
\end{pmatrix}$$

First, we need to find the determinant of $$A$$. This is done by expanding the determinant along the first row:

$$\det A = 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
8 & 10
\end{vmatrix} - 2 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
4 & 6 \\
7 & 10
\end{vmatrix} + 3 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
4 & 5 \\
7 & 8
\end{vmatrix} = -3$$

Next, we need to find the matrix of cofactors. This is done by taking the determinant of the minor matrix of each element of $$A$$.

$$\text{Cof}(A) = \begin{pmatrix}
\begin{vmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
8 & 10
\end{vmatrix} & -\begin{vmatrix}
4 & 6 \\
7 & 10
\end{vmatrix} & \begin{vmatrix}
4 & 5 \\
7 & 8
\end{vmatrix} \\
-\begin{vmatrix}
2 & 6 \\
8 & 10
\end{vmatrix} & \begin{vmatrix}
1 & 6 \\
7 & 10
\end{vmatrix} & -\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 5 \\
7 & 8
\end{vmatrix} \\
\begin{vmatrix}
2 & 5 \\
8 & 10
\end{vmatrix} & -\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 5 \\
7 & 10
\end{vmatrix} & \begin{vmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
7 & 8
\end{vmatrix}
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
4 & -2 & 1 \\
-2 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$$

Finally, we need to take the transpose of the matrix of cofactors.

$$\text{adj}(A) = \begin{pmatrix}
4 & -2 & 1 \\
-2 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}^T = \begin{pmatrix}
4 & -2 & 1 \\
-2 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$$

Now we can use the formula for finding the inverse to calculate $$A^{-1}$$:

$$A^{-1} = \frac{1}{-3} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
4 & -2 & 1 \\
-2 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{4}{3} & \frac{2}{3} & -\frac{1}{3} \\
\frac{2}{3} & -\frac{1}{3} & 0 \\
-\frac{1}{3} & 0 & \frac{1}{3}
\end{pmatrix}$$

### Practice

## E. Solving Systems of Equations with Matrices

### What is a System of Equations?

A system of equations is a set of two or more equations with the same set of variables. Solving a system of equations means finding a set of values for the variables that satisfy all of the equations.

### Solving Systems of Equations with Matrices

Matrices can be used to represent and solve a system of equations. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. A matrix can represent a system of equations if each row of the matrix represents one of the equations and each column represents one of the variables.

For example, consider the system of equations:

```
2x + 3y = 6
4x + 9y = 18
```

This system of equations can be represented by the following matrix:

```
| 2  3 |   |  x |   |  6 |
| 4  9 | * |  y | = | 18 |
```

The solution to a system of equations can be found by using the inverse of the matrix. The inverse of a matrix is found by multiplying the matrix by its inverse. The inverse of a matrix is denoted by A<sup>-1</sup>.

For example, consider the matrix above. The inverse of this matrix is:

```
| -9/13  3/13 |
|  4/13 -2/13 |
```

To solve the system of equations, the inverse of the matrix is multiplied by the vector of constants (the vector on the right side of the equation):

```
| -9/13  3/13 |   |  6 |
|  4/13 -2/13 | * | 18 |
```

The result is the vector of solutions:

```
|  x |   |  4/13 |
|  y | = | -2/13 |
```

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the following system of equations using matrices:

```
3x + 2y = 4
5x + 4y = 10
```

Answer:

The matrix representing the system of equations is:

```
|  3  2 |   |  x |   |  4 |
|  5  4 | * |  y | = | 10 |
```

The inverse of the matrix is:

```
| -4/7  2/7 |
|  5/7 -3/7 |
```

To solve the system of equations, the inverse of the matrix is multiplied by the vector of constants (the vector on the right side of the equation):

```
| -4/7  2/7 |   |  4 |
|  5/7 -3/7 | * | 10 |
```

The result is the vector of solutions:

```
|  x |   |  3/7 |
|  y | = |  1/7 |
```

2. Solve the following system of equations using matrices:

```
2x + y = 4
3x + 2y = 6
```

Answer:

The matrix representing the system of equations is:

```
|  2  1 |   |  x |   |  4 |
|  3  2 | * |  y | = |  6 |
```

The inverse of the matrix is:

```
| -2  1 |
|  3 -2 |
```

To solve the system of equations, the inverse of the matrix is multiplied by the vector of constants (the vector on the right side of the equation):

```
| -2  1 |   |  4 |
|  3 -2 | * |  6 |
```

The result is the vector of solutions:

```
|  x |   |  2 |
|  y | = |  2 |
```

## F. Determinants


### Introduction

In mathematics, a determinant is a scalar value that can be calculated from the elements of a square matrix. It can be used to solve systems of linear equations, find the inverse of a matrix, and calculate the area of a parallelogram. Determinants are important in many areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations.

### Calculating the Determinant

The determinant of a matrix can be calculated by using a variety of methods, including the Laplace expansion and the Sarrus rule.

#### Laplace Expansion

The Laplace expansion is a method for calculating the determinant of a matrix by expanding along a row or column. To use this method, choose a row or column and multiply each element in the row or column by its corresponding minor. The minor of an element is the determinant of the matrix formed by deleting the row and column containing the element. Then add or subtract the products of the elements and their minors, depending on their position in the row or column. The result is the determinant of the matrix.

#### Sarrus Rule

The Sarrus rule is an alternative method for calculating the determinant of a matrix. To use this method, choose any three elements in the matrix and multiply the first element by the second element, then subtract the product of the third element and the fourth element. The result is the determinant of the matrix.

### Properties of Determinants

Determinants have several useful properties. For example, the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. Additionally, the determinant of a matrix is equal to the sum of the products of the elements in any row or column, multiplied by the corresponding cofactors. The cofactor of an element is the determinant of the matrix formed by deleting the row and column containing the element, multiplied by the sign of the element.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Find the determinant of the following matrix:

```
A =
| 2  4  3 |
| 0  1  2 |
| 1 -1  0 |
```

Using the Laplace expansion method, we can choose the first row and expand along it.

The minor of the first element is the determinant of the matrix formed by deleting the first row and column, which is |1 -1| = 1.

The minor of the second element is the determinant of the matrix formed by deleting the first row and second column, which is |0 2| = 0.

The minor of the third element is the determinant of the matrix formed by deleting the first row and third column, which is |0 1| = 0.

Therefore, the determinant of the matrix is 2 * 1 - 4 * 0 + 3 * 0 = 2.

#### Example 2

Find the determinant of the following matrix:

```
B =
| 1  2  3 |
| 4  5  6 |
| 7  8  9 |
```

Using the Sarrus rule, we can choose any three elements in the matrix. Let's choose the first, fifth, and ninth elements.

The determinant of the matrix is 1 * 5 - 2 * 8 + 3 * 7 = -3.

## G. Cramer’s Rule


### Definition

Cramer's Rule is a method of solving a system of linear equations. It is an alternative to using matrices or substitution. The rule states that if a system of linear equations has a non-zero determinant, then the system can be solved by expressing the solution in terms of determinants of matrices related to the original matrix.

### Calculating Cramer's Rule

To calculate Cramer's Rule, we first need to calculate the determinant of the matrix. The determinant is a scalar value that is calculated from the elements of a square matrix. It can be calculated by expanding the matrix along any row or column.

Once the determinant is calculated, the value of each variable in the system of equations can be calculated using the following formula:

$$x_i = \frac{\text{det}(A_i)}{\text{det}(A)}$$

where $A_i$ is the matrix obtained by replacing the $i$th column of the original matrix $A$ with the column vector of constants from the system of equations.

### Example

Consider the system of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + y &= -4 \\
3x - y &= 7
\end{aligned}
$$

We can represent this system of equations as a matrix:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 \\
3 & -1
\end{bmatrix}$$

The determinant of this matrix is $\text{det}(A) = -5$.

To solve for $x$ and $y$, we need to calculate the determinants of the matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$, which are obtained by replacing the first and second columns of $A$ with the column vector of constants, respectively.

For $A_1$, we obtain:

$$A_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
-4 & 1 \\
7 & -1
\end{bmatrix}$$

The determinant of this matrix is $\text{det}(A_1) = -11$.

For $A_2$, we obtain:

$$A_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -4 \\
3 & 7
\end{bmatrix}$$

The determinant of this matrix is $\text{det}(A_2) = -5$.

Using Cramer's Rule, we can now calculate the values of $x$ and $y$:

$$x = \frac{\text{det}(A_1)}{\text{det}(A)} = \frac{-11}{-5} = 2.2$$

$$y = \frac{\text{det}(A_2)}{\text{det}(A)} = \frac{-5}{-5} = 1$$

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $x = 2.2$ and $y = 1$.

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the following system of equations using Cramer's Rule:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    x + y &= 4 \\
    2x - y &= -2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

2. Solve the following system of equations using Cramer's Rule:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    3x + 2y &= 5 \\
    x - y &= -1
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### Solutions

1. The matrix for this system of equations is

$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}$$

The determinant of this matrix is $\text{det}(A) = -3$.

To solve for $x$ and $y$, we need to calculate the determinants of the matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$, which are obtained by replacing the first and second columns of $A$ with the column vector of constants, respectively.

For $A_1$, we obtain:

$$A_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 1 \\
-2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}$$

The determinant of this matrix is $\text{det}(A_1) = 6$.

For $A_2$, we obtain:

$$A_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
1

## H. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors


### Introduction
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors are two important concepts in linear algebra that are used to solve linear equations and matrices. An eigenvalue is a scalar value associated with a linear transformation or matrix, and an eigenvector is a vector that, when multiplied by a matrix, produces a scalar multiple of itself.

### Eigenvalues
An eigenvalue of a matrix is a scalar value that is associated with a linear transformation or matrix. It is calculated by solving the equation Ax = λx, where A is the matrix, x is the eigenvector, and λ is the eigenvalue.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, which is calculated by finding the determinant of the matrix minus the identity matrix multiplied by λ.

### Eigenvectors
An eigenvector of a matrix is a vector that, when multiplied by the matrix, produces a scalar multiple of itself. It is calculated by solving the equation Ax = λx, where A is the matrix, x is the eigenvector, and λ is the eigenvalue.

The eigenvectors of a matrix are the solutions to the homogeneous equation Ax = 0.

### Examples
Here is an example of how to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.

Given the matrix A =

```
[2 -3]
[-1  4]
```

The characteristic polynomial is calculated by finding the determinant of the matrix minus the identity matrix multiplied by λ:

```
det(A - λI) =
[2-λ -3]
[-1  4-λ]

= (2-λ)(4-λ) - 3(-1)

= (2-λ)(4-λ) + 3

= λ² - 6λ + 5
```

The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, so they are λ = 3 and λ = 5.

To find the eigenvectors, we solve the homogeneous equation Ax = 0.

For λ = 3, the equation becomes:

```
[2 -3] [x] = [0]
[-1  4] [y]   [0]
```

Solving for x and y, we get x = -2 and y = 1. Therefore, the eigenvector for λ = 3 is [-2, 1].

For λ = 5, the equation becomes:

```
[2 -3] [x] = [0]
[-1  4] [y]   [0]
```

Solving for x and y, we get x = 1 and y = -2. Therefore, the eigenvector for λ = 5 is [1, -2].

# 12. Graphs of Algebraic Equations


## A. Introduction to Graphs


### What is a Graph?

A graph is a visual representation of data. It is a way of displaying information in a visual form, usually in the form of a chart or diagram. Graphs are typically used to display relationships between two or more variables. They can be used to show trends, compare values, and analyze data.

### Types of Graphs

There are many different types of graphs, including bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots, and pie charts. Each type of graph has its own purpose and can be used to display different types of data.

### Bar Graphs

Bar graphs are used to compare values between different categories. The data is displayed as bars, with the height of each bar representing the value of the category. Bar graphs are used to compare values between different categories.

### Line Graphs

Line graphs are used to show trends in data over time. The data is displayed as a line, with the points on the line representing the values at different points in time. Line graphs are used to show changes in data over time.

### Scatter Plots

Scatter plots are used to show the relationship between two variables. The data is displayed as points on a graph, with each point representing a value for each of the two variables. Scatter plots are used to show the correlation between two variables.

### Pie Charts

Pie charts are used to show the proportions of different parts of a whole. The data is displayed as a circle, with each "slice" of the circle representing a different part of the whole. Pie charts are used to show the proportions of different parts of a whole.

### Interpreting Graphs

Interpreting graphs is an important part of understanding data. It is important to be able to read and understand the information presented in a graph. When interpreting graphs, it is important to look at the labels, scales, and data points to understand the information being presented.

## B. Plotting Points on a Graph

### Introduction

Plotting points on a graph is an important skill for understanding algebraic equations. It allows us to visualize the relationships between different points and equations. In this section, we will discuss how to plot points on a graph and how to interpret the resulting graph.

### Plotting Points

A point on a graph is represented by two numbers, an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. The x-coordinate tells us how far along the x-axis a point is, and the y-coordinate tells us how far along the y-axis a point is. For example, the point (3, 4) would be 3 units along the x-axis and 4 units along the y-axis.

To plot a point on a graph, we first draw an x-axis and a y-axis. Then, we plot the point by marking the x-coordinate on the x-axis and the y-coordinate on the y-axis. Finally, we connect the two points with a line.

### Example

Let's plot the point (3, 4) on a graph. First, we draw an x-axis and a y-axis. Then, we mark the x-coordinate 3 on the x-axis and the y-coordinate 4 on the y-axis. Finally, we connect the two points with a line.

```
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   | * |   |   |
|   |   |   | * |   |
|   |   |   |   | * |
```

### Practice

Now, let's practice plotting points on a graph.

1. Plot the point (2, 5)

```
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   | * |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   | * |
|   |   |   |   |   |
```

2. Plot the point (4, 2)

```
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   | * |   |
|   | * |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
```

### Summary

In this section, we have discussed how to plot points on a graph. We have seen how to mark the x-coordinate and y-coordinate on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, and how to connect the two points with a line. We have also practiced plotting points on a graph.

## C. Graphing Linear Equations

### Introduction

A linear equation is an equation whose solution set is a line. Linear equations are the most basic form of equations and are used to model many real-world situations. Graphing linear equations is a fundamental skill in algebra, and it is important to understand how to graph linear equations in order to understand more complex equations and graph them accurately.

### Plotting Points

In order to graph a linear equation, we must first plot points. To do this, we must choose a value for the independent variable (usually x) and substitute it into the equation to find the corresponding value of the dependent variable (usually y). This process is repeated for several values of x, and the resulting points are plotted on the coordinate plane.

For example, let's consider the equation y = 2x + 1. To plot points, we will choose values for x and substitute them into the equation to find the corresponding y values.

| x | y = 2x + 1 |
| - | ---------- |
| -2 | -3 |
| -1 | -1 |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 5 |

We can then plot these points on a coordinate plane to graph the equation.

### Graphing Linear Equations

Once we have plotted the points, we can draw a line through them to graph the equation. This line will have a slope and a y-intercept. The slope is the rate at which the line changes, and it is determined by the coefficient of the x term in the equation. The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, and it is determined by the constant term in the equation.

In the example above, the equation is y = 2x + 1. The coefficient of the x term is 2, so the slope of the line is 2. The constant term is 1, so the y-intercept is (0, 1). We can use these values to graph the equation.

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the equation y = -3x + 2.

2. Graph the equation y = -x + 4.

3. Graph the equation y = 4x - 3.

### Solutions

1. The equation is y = -3x + 2. The coefficient of the x term is -3, so the slope of the line is -3. The constant term is 2, so the y-intercept is (0, 2). We can use these values to graph the equation.

2. The equation is y = -x + 4. The coefficient of the x term is -1, so the slope of the line is -1. The constant term is 4, so the y-intercept is (0, 4). We can use these values to graph the equation.

3. The equation is y = 4x - 3. The coefficient of the x term is 4, so the slope of the line is 4. The constant term is -3, so the y-intercept is (0, -3). We can use these values to graph the equation.

## D. Graphing Quadratic Equations


### What is a Quadratic Equation?
A quadratic equation is an equation of the form:

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. Quadratic equations are used to model a variety of real-world phenomena, including projectile motion, electrical circuits, and population growth.

### Graphing Quadratic Equations

Graphing quadratic equations is a useful tool for understanding the behavior of the equation. To graph a quadratic equation, we need to find the roots (or zeros) of the equation and then plot them on the graph.

#### Finding the Roots

The roots of a quadratic equation can be found using the **quadratic formula**, which is:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the constants in the equation.

For example, let's consider the equation $x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0$. The constants in this equation are $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = -3$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula yields:

$$x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot -3}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{2} = -3, 1$$

So, the roots of the equation are $x = -3$ and $x = 1$.

#### Plotting the Roots

Now that we have the roots of the equation, we can plot them on a graph. To do this, we first need to find the **vertex** of the equation. The vertex is the point at which the graph of the equation reaches its highest or lowest point.

The vertex of a quadratic equation can be found using the formula:

$$\left(x, y\right) = \left(\frac{-b}{2a}, f\left(\frac{-b}{2a}\right)\right)$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the constants in the equation.

For our example equation, the vertex is:

$$\left(x, y\right) = \left(\frac{-2}{2 \cdot 1}, f\left(\frac{-2}{2 \cdot 1}\right)\right) = \left(-1, f(-1)\right)$$

Now, we can plot the vertex and the roots on the graph.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VuJfHnN.png" width="400">

#### Interpreting the Graph

The graph of a quadratic equation is a **parabola**. The vertex of the parabola is the point at which the graph reaches its highest or lowest point, and the roots are the points at which the graph intersects the x-axis.

From the graph, we can see that the equation has two roots: $x = -3$ and $x = 1$. We can also see that the vertex of the equation is at the point $(-1, 4)$.

#### Practice Problems

1. Graph the equation $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$.

2. Graph the equation $3x^2 - 2x + 7 = 0$.

3. Graph the equation $5x^2 - 8x + 4 = 0$.

### Solutions

1.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VNU9y0l.png" width="400">

The roots of the equation are $x = -1$ and $x = 1$, and the vertex is at the point $(-2, -3)$.

2.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/U6hjdSV.png" width="400">

The roots of the equation are $x = \frac{1}{3}$ and $x = 4$, and the vertex is at the point $(\frac{2}{3}, -\frac{5}{9})$.

## E. Graphing Polynomial Equations


#### Introduction

A polynomial equation is an equation with one or more terms that involve only non-negative integer powers of a single variable. Graphing polynomial equations is a fundamental skill that is essential for understanding higher-level algebra concepts. In this subsection, we will learn how to graph polynomial equations.

#### Plotting Points

Before we can graph a polynomial equation, we must first plot points on the graph. To do this, we must first identify the x-values and y-values of the equation. For example, consider the equation:

$$y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 2$$

We can identify the x-values and y-values by plugging in different values for x and solving for y. For example, if we plug in x=2, we get y=20. Therefore, the point (2,20) is on the graph of this equation. We can repeat this process for other values of x.

#### Graphing Polynomial Equations

Once we have plotted several points on the graph, we can connect them with a smooth curve. This curve is the graph of the polynomial equation.

For example, let's take a look at the equation from the previous section:

$$y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 2$$

If we plug in x=2, we get y=20. Therefore, the point (2,20) is on the graph of this equation. If we plug in x=-2, we get y=-14. Therefore, the point (-2,-14) is also on the graph of this equation.

We can repeat this process for other values of x, such as x=1, x=0, and x=-1. Once we have plotted several points on the graph, we can connect them with a smooth curve. This curve is the graph of the polynomial equation.

#### Interpreting Graphs

Once we have graphed a polynomial equation, we can interpret the graph to gain insight into the equation. For example, the graph of a polynomial equation can tell us the following:

- The highest and lowest points on the graph (the maximum and minimum values of the equation)
- The number of times the graph crosses the x-axis (the number of real roots of the equation)
- The number of times the graph crosses the y-axis (the number of imaginary roots of the equation)
- The shape of the graph (whether the equation is increasing, decreasing, or neither)

#### Practice Problems

1. Graph the equation: $$y = x^4 + 3x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 1$$

2. Graph the equation: $$y = x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1$$

3. Graph the equation: $$y = x^2 - 4x + 3$$

4. Graph the equation: $$y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 2$$

5. Interpret the graph of the equation: $$y = x^2 - 3x + 1$$

6. Interpret the graph of the equation: $$y = x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x + 1$$

## F. Graphing Radical Equations


### Introduction to Graphing Radical Equations

Radical equations are equations that contain a radical symbol, such as the square root symbol. Graphing radical equations is a bit more complicated than graphing linear or quadratic equations, as the graph of a radical equation is not a straight line.

### Graphing Radical Equations

To graph a radical equation, we need to find the x-intercepts and the y-intercepts of the equation.

#### Finding the x-intercepts

The x-intercepts of a radical equation are the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. To find the x-intercepts, we set the equation equal to 0 and solve for x.

For example, consider the equation `y = √(x-2)`. To find the x-intercepts, we set the equation equal to 0 and solve for x:

```
√(x-2) = 0
x-2 = 0
x = 2
```

Therefore, the x-intercept of this equation is `x = 2`.

#### Finding the y-intercepts

The y-intercepts of a radical equation are the points where the graph crosses the y-axis. To find the y-intercepts, we set the equation equal to 0 and solve for y.

For example, consider the equation `y = √(x-2)`. To find the y-intercepts, we set the equation equal to 0 and solve for y:

```
√(x-2) = 0
√(0) = 0
0 = 0
```

Therefore, the y-intercept of this equation is `y = 0`.

#### Plotting the Graph

Once we have found the x-intercepts and y-intercepts, we can plot the graph. We start by plotting the x-intercepts and y-intercepts on the graph. Then, we draw a smooth curve that passes through the points.

For example, consider the equation `y = √(x-2)`. We have already found the x-intercepts and y-intercepts:

- x-intercept: `x = 2`
- y-intercept: `y = 0`

We can plot these points on the graph:

Then, we draw a smooth curve that passes through the points:

## G. Graphing Rational Equations


### What is a Rational Equation?
A rational equation is a type of equation that involves fractions. It is an equation that contains fractions that have variables in the numerator and/or denominator. Rational equations are also known as fractional equations.

### Graphing Rational Equations
To graph a rational equation, we need to first determine the x-intercepts and y-intercepts of the equation. The x-intercepts are the points where the graph crosses the x-axis, and the y-intercepts are the points where the graph crosses the y-axis.

Once the x-intercepts and y-intercepts of the equation are determined, we can plot the points on the graph and draw a line connecting the points. The line that connects the points is the graph of the rational equation.

### Example
Let's look at an example of how to graph a rational equation. Consider the equation:

$$ \frac{x^2 - 2x + 1}{x - 3} = 0 $$

To graph this equation, we first need to find the x-intercepts and y-intercepts. To find the x-intercepts, we set the numerator equal to zero and solve for x. This gives us:

$$ x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 $$

Solving this equation, we get x = 1 and x = 3. These are the x-intercepts of the equation. To find the y-intercept, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for x. This gives us:

$$ x - 3 = 0 $$

Solving this equation, we get x = 3. This is the y-intercept of the equation.

Now that we have the x-intercepts and y-intercepts, we can plot the points on the graph and draw a line connecting the points. The line that connects the points is the graph of the rational equation.

We can also graph the equation using a graphing calculator. The graph of the equation looks like this:

![Graphing Rational Equations](https://i.imgur.com/wfH3KfM.png)

### Practice Problems
Try graphing the following rational equations:

1. $$ \frac{x^2 - 4x + 4}{x - 2} = 0 $$
2. $$ \frac{x^2 + 2x + 1}{x^2 - 4} = 0 $$
3. $$ \frac{2x - 3}{x^2 + 1} = 0 $$

### Solutions
1. The x-intercepts are x = 2 and x = 4, and the y-intercept is x = 2. The graph of the equation looks like this:

![Graphing Rational Equations](https://i.imgur.com/zVjTfjJ.png)

2. The x-intercepts are x = -2 and x = 2, and the y-intercept is x = 0. The graph of the equation looks like this:

![Graphing Rational Equations](https://i.imgur.com/Gzf2Jjf.png)

3. The x-intercepts are x = 0 and x = -3, and the y-intercept is x = 0. The graph of the equation looks like this:

## H. Interpreting Graphs


### What is a Graph?

A graph is a visual representation of a mathematical relationship. It is composed of two axes, the x-axis and the y-axis, and a series of points that are plotted on the graph. The x-axis is typically the independent variable, while the y-axis is typically the dependent variable.

### Interpreting Graphs

Interpreting a graph is the process of understanding and interpreting the data presented in the graph. It involves understanding the shape of the graph, the type of relationship between the variables, and the overall trends that are present in the data.

#### Identifying the Shape of the Graph

The shape of the graph can tell us a lot about the type of relationship between the variables. For example, a linear graph will have a straight line shape, while a quadratic graph will have a curved line shape.

#### Identifying the Type of Relationship

The type of relationship between the variables can be identified by looking at the slope of the graph. A positive slope indicates a positive correlation, while a negative slope indicates a negative correlation.

#### Identifying Overall Trends

Overall trends can be identified by looking at the general shape of the graph. For example, a graph that is increasing indicates an overall upward trend, while a graph that is decreasing indicates an overall downward trend.

### Practice Problems

1. Identify the shape of the graph and the type of relationship between the variables in the following graph:

![Graph](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/graph-linear.svg)

Answer: The graph is linear and has a positive slope, indicating a positive correlation between the variables.

2. Identify the overall trend in the following graph:

![Graph](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/graph-quadratic.svg)

Answer: The graph is decreasing, indicating an overall downward trend.

## I. Graphing Inequalities


### Introduction

Inequalities are mathematical statements that express the relationship between two values. They are often used to describe real-world situations, such as the cost of a product being greater than a certain amount. Inequalities are written in the form of an expression with a comparison operator, such as “<” or “>”.

In this section, we will learn how to graph inequalities. We will also learn how to interpret the graphs of inequalities.

### Plotting Points

The first step in graphing an inequality is to plot the points that satisfy the inequality. To do this, we will use the comparison operator to determine which values of x are valid for the inequality. For example, if we have the inequality x < 5, then any value of x that is less than 5 is valid. We can then plot these points on the graph.

### Graphing Linear Inequalities

Once we have plotted the points that satisfy the inequality, we can then graph the inequality. To graph a linear inequality, we will draw a line that passes through the points we have plotted. We will then shade the area of the graph that satisfies the inequality.

For example, if we have the inequality x < 5, then we will draw a line that passes through the points we have plotted. We will then shade the area of the graph that is below the line. This area represents all of the values of x that satisfy the inequality.

### Graphing Quadratic Inequalities

Graphing a quadratic inequality is similar to graphing a linear inequality. However, instead of drawing a line, we will draw a parabola. We will then shade the area of the graph that satisfies the inequality.

For example, if we have the inequality x2 < 5, then we will draw a parabola that passes through the points we have plotted. We will then shade the area of the graph that is below the parabola. This area represents all of the values of x that satisfy the inequality.

### Interpreting the Graph

Once we have graphed the inequality, we can then interpret the graph. To do this, we will look at the area that is shaded. This area represents all of the values of x that satisfy the inequality.

For example, if we have the inequality x < 5, then the area that is shaded represents all of the values of x that are less than 5. This means that any value of x that is in the shaded area is valid for the inequality.

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the inequality x > 5
2. Graph the inequality x2 > 4
3. Graph the inequality x2 < -2
4. Graph the inequality x2 + 2x > 4
5. Interpret the graph of the inequality x2 + 2x > 4

## J. Graphing Systems of Equations

### Introduction

A system of equations is a set of two or more equations containing two or more variables. Graphing systems of equations can be an effective way to solve the equations and find the solutions. In this section, we will explore how to graph a system of equations and how to interpret the results.

### Plotting Points

The first step in graphing a system of equations is to plot the points that satisfy the equations. To do this, we must solve each equation for one of the variables and substitute the resulting value into the other equation. For example, if we have the system of equations:

$$
\begin{align}
x + y &= 4 \\
2x + 3y &= 10
\end{align}
$$

We can solve the first equation for $y$ to get $y = 4 - x$, and then substitute this into the second equation to get $2x + 3(4 - x) = 10$, which can be simplified to $2x - 3x = -2$ and then $x = 2$. We can then substitute this value for $x$ into either equation to get $y = 2$. Therefore, the point $(2,2)$ satisfies both equations, and we can plot it on a graph.

### Graphing the Equations

Once we have plotted the points that satisfy the equations, we can graph the equations themselves. To do this, we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation, $y = mx + b$, to find the slope and y-intercept of each equation. For example, if we have the equation $3x + 4y = 12$, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = \frac{12 - 3x}{4}$. This means that the slope of the equation is $m = -\frac{3}{4}$ and the y-intercept is $b = 3$. We can then use this information to graph the equation.

### Interpreting the Graph

Once we have graphed the equations, we can interpret the results. If the two lines intersect at a single point, then that point is the solution to the system of equations. If the two lines are parallel, then there is no solution. If the two lines are the same line, then there are an infinite number of solutions.

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the system of equations $y = 2x + 3$ and $y = x - 2$.
2. Graph the system of equations $2x + y = 6$ and $3x - y = 3$.
3. Graph the system of equations $y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 4$ and $y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2$.

### Solutions

1. The two lines intersect at the point $(-1,1)$, so this is the solution to the system of equations.

2. The two lines intersect at the point $(2,0)$, so this is the solution to the system of equations.

3. The two lines intersect at the point $(4,-2)$, so this is the solution to the system of equations.
